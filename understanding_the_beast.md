# The Developer Path

##### Developers are tough.

They can sit 12 hours in front of a computer. 

They can bypass regular sleep for months when passionate by an idea. 

They go layer after layer building a considerable chain of logical paths in their brains. 

Yes, they dress casually. Being simple saves time. Grooming is rarely a priority. 

Like kids, they get along with each other quickly. All they need is to speak the same mother tongue. Do you know JavaScript ? Shit yes. (Smile). Let's talk !  

They have bugs to fix, called “debugging”. To debug is often hell. It requires to step into someone else’s shoes and understand their logic. It can take from 5 mins to a few days in Armageddon. 

To add more juice to our mix, with today’s web,  they’ve got even more radical. If they don't see the beauty of a concept in 5 examples or a 3 minutes video, oh boy, your technology or framework will be trashed. They will not hesitate a second to spend energy elsewhere. 

I’ve worked as a developer, project manager and project director for a long time. I can assure something else: they have an incredible sense of detecting bullshit, if being told. 

At this point of the chapter, If you are a developer and I did not pass your bullshiting test, you are already getting another book.  

Their apparently laziness hides a deep love about automate everything around them. They love to do things faster and with less effort, this is always in the back of their minds. After all, extra time is key on getting even geekier.   

Developers are bodybuilders for logical thinking. They step over pain and stress while muscling their thoughts. They juggle a considerable amount of information in their heads.  

They are mental beasts, often with a geek sweetness and fragile face. 

Watch out. 

In today’s world they are getting ahead as never before, making fortunes, being stars in the news. 
In other words: 

They are conquering the world.
