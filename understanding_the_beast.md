# The Developer

##### Developers are tough.

They can sit 12 hours in front of a computer. 

They can bypass regular sleep for months when passionate by an idea. 

They go layer after layer building a considerable chain of logical paths in their brains. 

Yes, they dress casually. Grooming is rarely a priority. Being simple saves time.  

Like kids, they get along with each other quickly. All they need is to speak the same mother tongue. Do you know JavaScript ? Shit yes. (Smile). Let's talk !  

They have bugs to fix, called “debugging”. To debug is often hell. It requires to step into someone else’s shoes and understand their logic. It can take from 5 mins to a few days in Armageddon. 

If Developers don't see logical beauty or simplicity in a product,  oh boy, your technology or framework will be trashed without pity. They will not hesitate a second to spend energy elsewhere. 

I’ve worked as a developer, project manager and project director and I can assure something else: they have an excellent sense for detecting bullshit, if being told. 

As matter fact I know that, if this book did not pass your preliminary test, you are already moving on to another thing.  

Developers have a deep love for automating everything around them. They love to do things faster and with less effort. After all, an extra time is always well used on getting geekier.   

Developers are bodybuilders for logical thinking. They step over pain and stress while muscling their thoughts. They juggle a considerable amount of information in their heads while working.  

They are mental beasts, often with a geek sweetness and fragile face. 

Watch out. 

In today’s world they are getting ahead as never before, making fortunes, being stars in the news. 
In other words: 

They are conquering the world.
