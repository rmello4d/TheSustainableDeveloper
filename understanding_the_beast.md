# The Developer

##### Developers are tough.

They can sit 12 hours in front of a computer. 

They can bypass regular sleep when passionate by an idea. 

They go layer after layer building a considerable chain of logical paths in their brains. 

Yes, they dress casually, being simple saves time.  

They get along with each other quickly. All they need is to speak the same mother tongue. 

Do you know JavaScript ? 

Shit yes. 

(Smile). 

Let's talk !  

They have bugs to fix, called “debugging”. To debug is often hell. It requires to step into someone else’s shoes and understand their logic. It can take from 5 mins to a few days in Armageddon. 

If Developers don't see logical beauty or simplicity out of the box,  oh dear, your technology or framework will be trashed without pity. They do not hesitate a second to spend energy elsewhere. 

Developers have a deep love for automating everything around them. They love to do things faster and with less effort.

They are bodybuilders for logical thinking, stepping over pain and stress while muscling their thoughts. 

They are mental beasts, often with a geek sweetness and fragile face. 

Watch out. 

In today’s world they are getting ahead as never before, making fortunes, being stars in the news. 

They are conquering the world.
