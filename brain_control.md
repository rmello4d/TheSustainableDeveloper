#Brain Control

Can we control your brain ?

No.

It is important to dismistify the frenzy around posessing this magical power. 

The brain was not meant or designed to be "controlled".

Our brain is like an ocean receiving all the flowing rivers from the senses and that is not part of our decisions. 

We can see our brain as a "super recorder" running in a forever 'on' mode.

Uur brain registers everything we touch, listen, see, taste, smell, eat. Even when you sleep your brain is active. 

Think of a black hole grabbing and absorbing everything within range of your sensory boundaries. 

Nothing escapes.

On top of that, the brain regulates important activities in your body, from hormones delivery to blood circulation.

Bottom line: the brain is a vital organ and nature was smart enough to take the control off our hands. 

Do we control our heart ? Our liver ? No, and that is a good thing. Vital organs are self regulated, independent of your control and the brain falls in that category.

Our brain is not your puppet.   It is an organ too complex, powerful and designed to go beyond our control.

Having said that, if we can't control it, what's all the fuss about it ?
