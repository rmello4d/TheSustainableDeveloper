#Brain Control

Can we control our brain ?

No.

It is important to demystify the frenzy about possessing magical powers over our brain. 

The brain was not meant or designed to be "controlled".

Metaphorically speaking, our brain is like an ocean receiving all the flowing rivers from the senses. It is a black hole grabbing and absorbing everything within range of our sensory boundaries. 

Nothing escapes.

Our brain registers everything we touch, listen, see, taste, smell, eat. Even at deep sleep your brain is active. 

On top of that, the brain also regulates important activities in our body, from hormones delivery to blood circulation.

The brain is a vital organ and nature was smart enough to take the control off our hands. 

Do we control our heart ? Our liver ? No, and that is a good thing. Vital organs are self regulated and independent of our control. 

Bottom line: The brain is not our puppet. It is an organ too complex, powerful and designed to go beyond our control.

Having said that, if we can't control it, what's all the fuss about it ?

The use of our brain is direct related to the levels of energy we have. In the sense of energy consumption, we should detail a plan to cut waste and run the brain engine much leaner. 

No magical power needed. 

Let's now define the brain areas under our control.
