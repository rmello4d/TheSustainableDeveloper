#Brain Control

Can we control our brain ?

No.

It is important to dismistify this frenzy around posessing a magical power over this organ. 

The brain was not meant or designed to be "controlled".

Our brain is like an ocean receiving all the flowing rivers from the senses and that is not part of our decisions. 

Metaphorically speaking, we can see our brain as a "super recorder" running in a forever 'on' mode.

Our brain registers everything we touch, listen, see, taste, smell, eat. Even when you sleep your brain is active. 

A black hole grabbing and absorbing everything within range of our sensory boundaries. 

Nothing escapes.

On top of that, the brain regulates important activities in our body, from hormones delivery to blood circulation.

Bottom line: the brain is a vital organ and nature was smart enough to take the control off our hands. 

Do we control our heart ? Our liver ? No, and that is a good thing. Vital organs are self regulated and independent of our control. The brain falls in that category.

It is not our puppet. It is an organ too complex, powerful and designed to go beyond our control.

Having said that, if we can't control it, what's all the fuss about it ?
