# About the Author

I've started my professional life as a software developer in 1989. I also had, in parallel, a musical career as a classical guitar player. Both activities demanded long hours of personal commitment.  

After than 10 years of intense work, I've developed pain and body exhaustion caused by tendonitis and dupuytrens. These problems were partially neglected and they soon became permanent injury.

In 1999, a friend recommended Meditation and Yoga. I tried my first class while living in Colorado, US. Since then, Yoga and Meditation became part of my life style. 

To my surprise I was not just learning about Yoga and Meditation, these practices were impacting my life as a Developer and Musician. 'Coincidentally' my Music and Software Development careers took off. 

This book tells my failures and successes as a Software developer, Musician and Yoga teacher.   

They are personal but hopefully will help you as well.
