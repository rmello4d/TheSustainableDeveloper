# About the Author

I  my professional life to software development and music.

After 15 years of intense work, I've developed pain and body exhaustion caused by tendonitis and dupuytrens. These problems were partially neglected and they soon became permanent injury.

By that time, a friend recommended Meditation and Yoga. I tried my first class  in 1999. Since then, Yoga and Meditation became part of my life style. 

To my surprise I was not just learning about Yoga and Meditation, these practices were impacting my life as a Developer and Musician. 'Coincidentally' the Music and Software Development careers took off. 

This book tells my failures and successes as a Software developer, Musician and Yoga teacher.   

They are personal but hopefully will help you as well. 

Will there be any coding examples ? Yes.  Although I will try my best to invite non-coders to understand our world. 

Last but not least, please share your opinion about anything you believe right or wrong in this book. One way or the other, you are helping me to spread and enlarge this conversation even further. 

Enjoy it !
