# Beyond Muscles

#####Physical activity is a popular mantra. 

Get Strong. Build Muscles. Stay healthy. 

These messages are useful and we have raised consciousness over the years about the  importance of being active and regular exercising. 

Now is time to evolve and bring this mantra a little further.

To go further, we have to reach our joints, ligaments and our deep tissue.

Just to clarify, we use our joints, ligaments and tendons while exercising.  

The important question is, how far are we using them ? 

Evolution kept joints and ligaments's motion between a certain security range. The reason for that is probably survival. Having a joint or ligament problem could have a devastating impact in our movement. 

We would be a much easier pray. 

Who is the guardian keeping joints and ligaments secure ? Muscles.

Among other things, muscles make sure our joints and ligaments do not bend or stretch over a certain limit. Muscles are protecting them so they don't break apart. 

The idea of muscles protecting our joints and ligaments is logical and makes sense. Since nature took care of that, why should we bring our joints or ligaments even further? Wouldn't that be dangerous? 

No. There are no risks if done well.   

We start life physically loosen. A baby can touch its heels on the back of its skull if needed.  

Progressively we build some body tension by growing up. As we grow older and older, we get stiffer and curbed by life. 

What is getting stiffer and curbed ? Our joints, ligaments, tendons and the deep tissue. 

Ask any elderly person and they will probably confirm: their  pain is on the joints, tendons and ligaments. 

The muscles? They work fine. 

Lets also remember that modern life has some levels of comfort that, instead of positively stress our joints and ligaments, make them worse. (*)

The idea of keeping our joints and ligaments healthier is a sustainable concern. It has important future consequences. 

For a developer, this is even more important. We often have physical problems related to joints, tendons and ligaments. 

Tendonitis, Dupuytrens, Carpal Tunnel, Bulge Disks, back pain and etc.  We can develop any of these problems after some years of coding.  

Is there a safe way to open and bring more flow and circulation to our joints and ligaments ? Yes. 

There are techniques for that and we will see them along the book, specially Yoga. 

Some forms of Yoga act beyond the muscles. They increase flow and circulation into our deep tissues.  

Imagine yourself as a developer *Homo erectus* at 90 years old. No joints, discs, tendons or ligaments problems. 

We need to transform all these years working into a health bank for our joints and ligaments. 

We will discuss the best postures and ideas to positively impact the developer's daily life in the Second Part of this book. 

As for now, keep vivid the importance of going beyond our muscles into our deep tissue. It will pay off.
