# Beyond Muscles

#####Physical activity is a popular mantra. 

Get Strong. Build Muscles. Stay healthy. 

Over the years, we have raised consciousness about the  importance of being active and about exercising our body. These messages are useful and we want to evolve and bring this mantra a little further.

To go further, we have to reach our joints, ligaments, articulations and our deep tissue.

Why is this important? Health and personal energy. 

We all started life extremely flexible. A baby can touch its heels on the back of its head if needed.  

Progressively we build some body tension by growing up. As we grow older and older, we get stiffer and bent by life. 

What is getting stiffer? Our joints, ligaments, tendons and the deep tissue. 

Ask any elderly person and they will often confirm: their pain is on the joints, tendons, articulations and ligaments. 

The muscles? They work fine.

The idea of keeping our joints and ligaments healthier is a sustainable concern. It has important consequences for our health and our range of motion. 

For a developer, this is even more important. We don't need to get older to have physical problems related to joints, tendons and ligaments: 

Tendonitis, Dupuytrens, Carpal Tunnel, Bulge Disks, back pain and etc.  We can develop any of these problems after some years of coding.  

Joints and ligaments are so important that our body is often trying to protect them. This is probably due to our survival. Back in the savanna, we would be an easy pray if we had a problem on a joint or a ligament. 

Who is the guardian keeping joints and ligaments safe? Muscles.

Among other things, muscles try their best to protect our joints and ligaments from bending or stretching over a certain limit. 

If our muscles are protecting our joints and ligaments, why do we have problems later on? 

The point here is that muscles keep our joints and ligaments in a limited range of motion. Safety is the main concern. If we don't challenge that, year after year this range gets shorter, toxins accumulate and we end up stiff and curbed.  

Is there a safe way to open our joints and ligaments further? 
Yes. We need to go beyond our muscles. 

There are specific techniques to challenge our joints and ligaments. Some forms of Yoga are specifically target for that. They increase circulation by opening our joints and ligaments gently and safely. 

Imagine yourself as a developer *Homo erectus* at 90 years old. No joints, discs, tendons or ligaments problems. 

The muscles ? They work fine. 

The Sustainable Developer is concern about transforming her working hours into a 'health bank' for her joints, ligaments and deep tissue. 

We will discuss the best postures and ideas to positively impact the developer's daily life in the Second Part of this book. 

As for now, keep vivid the importance of going beyond our muscles into our deep tissue. 

It will pay off.
