# Beyond Muscles

#####Physical activity is a popular mantra. 

Get Strong. Build Muscles. Stay healthy. 

These messages are great and we have raised the level of consciousness over the years about this subject. 

Now is time to evolve and bring this mantra a little further.

To go further, we have to reach our joints, ligaments and our deep tissue.

Just to clarify, we use our joints, ligaments and tendons while exercising.  

The important question is, how far are we using them ? 

Evolution kept joints and ligaments's motion between a certain security range. The reason for that is probably survival. Having a joint or ligament problem could have a devastating impact in our movement. 

We would be a much easier pray. 

Who is the guardian keeping joints and ligaments secure ? Muscles.

Muscles make sure our joints and ligaments do not bend or stretch over a certain limit. Muscles are protecting them so they don't break apart. 

Yes, muscles help a great deal carrying luggage as well.  

The idea of muscles protecting our joints and ligaments is logical and makes sense. Since nature took care of that, why should we bring our joints or ligaments even further? Wouldn't that be dangerous? 

Not if done well. 

We start life physically loosen. A baby can touch its heels on the back of its skull if needed.  Slowly and surely we build some body tension by growing up. As we grow older and older, we also get stiffer and curbed by life. What is getting stiffer and curbed ? Our joints, ligaments, tendons and parts of the deep tissue. 

Ask any elderly person and they will probably confirm: their  pain is on the joints, tendons and ligaments. 

The muscles? They work fine. 

Lets also remember that modern life has some levels of comfort that, instead of positively stress our joints and ligaments, make them worse. 

The idea of keeping our joints and ligaments healthier is a sustainable concern. It has important future consequences. 

For a developer, this is even more important. The amount of physical problems related to tendonitis, dupuytrens, carpal tunnel, bulge disks, back pain and etc is real. You can develop any of these problems after some years of coding. 

Is there a safe way to open and bring more flow and circulation to our joints and ligaments ? Yes. There are techniques for that and one of the best is Yin Yoga. 

Yin Yoga acts beyond the muscles to increase flow and circulation into our deep tissue. 

As we will see later, Yin Yoga's best postures and ideas positively impact the developer's daily life. (*)

Imagine yourself as a developer *Homo erectus* at 90 years old. No joints, discs, tendons or ligaments problems. 

We need to transform all these years working into a health bank for our joints and ligaments. 

As for now, keep vivid the importance of going beyond our muscles into our deep tissue. It will pay off.
