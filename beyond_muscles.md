# Beyond Muscles

#####Physical activity is a popular mantra. 

Get Strong. Build Muscles. Stay healthy. 

Over the years, we have raised consciousness about the  importance of being active and about exercising our body. These messages are useful. 

Now, let's go further in this mantra, we have to reach our joints, ligaments, tendons and cartilages. 

Why is this important?  

We all started life flexible. A baby can touch its heels on the back of its head if needed.  

Progressively we build tension in our body. As we grow older and older we get stiffer and stiffer, bent by life. 

What is getting stiffer? 

Ask any elderly person and they will often confirm: their pain is on the joints, tendons and ligaments. 

The muscles? They work fine.

The idea of keeping our joints and ligaments healthier is a sustainable concern. It has important consequences for our health and our range of motion while living in our blue planet. 

For a developer, this is even more important. Developers don't need to get older to have physical problems related to joints, tendons and ligaments: 

Tendonitis, Dupuytrens, Carpal Tunnel, Bulge Disks, back pain and etc.  Developers can have any of these problems after some years of coding.  

Joints and ligaments are so important that our body is often trying to overprotect them. This is probably due to our survival. Back in the savanna, we would be an easy pray if we had a broken joint or a torn ligament . 

Who is the guardian keeping joints and ligaments safe? Muscles.

Among other things, muscles try their best to protect our joints and ligaments from bending or stretching over a certain limit. 

Here is an interesting question. If our muscles are protecting our joints and ligaments, why we often have problems later on in life? 

The point is that muscles keep our joints and ligaments under a protected and limited range of motion. Safety is the main concern. 

If we don't challenge it, year after year this range gets shorter, toxins accumulate and we end up stiffer and stiffer. 
Is there a safe way to open our joints and ligaments further? 
Yes. For that, we need to go beyond our muscles. We also need to do it safely.  

There are specific techniques to open our joints and ligaments. These techniques challenge the muscles in a  different way, it is not about strenght, it is about release and trust. Nonetheless, these techniques increase circulation by opening our joints and ligaments gently and safely. 

Imagine yourself as a developer *Homo erectus* at 90 years old. No joints, discs, tendons or ligaments problems. 

We will discuss these techniques to positively impact the daily life of developers in the Second Part of the book. 

To become a Sustainable Developer,  we need to transform our working hours into a 'health bank' for our joints, ligaments and deep tissue. 

As for now, keep vivid the importance of our joints, ligaments and tendons. The muscles ? They will work fine.
