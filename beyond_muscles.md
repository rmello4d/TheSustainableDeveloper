# The Muscles

#####Physical activity is a popular mantra. 

Get Strong. Build Muscles. Stay healthy. 

Over the years, our society have raised consciousness about the  importance of being active and about exercising our body. These messages are useful. 

Although exercising is important, to obtain maximum performance developers need to reach their joints, ligaments, tendons and cartilages. 

Why is this crucial?  

We all started life flexible. A baby can touch its heels on their head if needed.  

Progressively we build tension in our body. As we grow older and older we get stiffer and stiffer, bent by life. 

What is getting stiffer? Joints, ligaments, tendons and cartilages. 

Ask any elderly person and they will often confirm: their pain is on the joints, tendons and ligaments. 

The muscles? They work fine.

The bad news is that developers don't need to get older to show physical problems related to joints, tendons and ligaments: 

Tendonitis, Dupuytrens, Carpal Tunnel, Bulge Disks, back pain, the list goes on and on. Developers can have any of these problems after some years of coding.  

To get even worse, these are slow and progressive problems. We should care as early as possible. 

Joints and ligaments are vital and our body is often trying to overprotect them. Guess who is the guardian keeping joints and ligaments safe? Muscles.

Among other things, muscles try their best to protect our joints and ligaments from bending or stretching over a certain limit. 

That is all good but if our muscles are protecting our joints and ligaments, why we often have problems later in life? 

The key is that muscles keep our joints and ligaments under a limited range of motion. Safety is the body main concern. 

If we don't challenge it, year after year this range gets shorter, toxins accumulate and we end up stiffer and stiffer. 

Is there a safe way to open our joints and ligaments further? Yes and sure there is a specific branch of Yoga for that. 

This Yoga technique challenges the joints in a  different way. It is not about strength, it is about release and trust. Nonetheless, this technique increases circulation by opening our joints and ligaments gently and safely. 

Imagine yourself as a developer *Homo erectus* at 90 years old. No joints, discs, tendons or ligaments problems. 

To become a Sustainable Developer,  we need to transform our working hours into a 'health bank' for our joints, ligaments and deep tissue. 

As for now, keep vivid the importance of our joints, ligaments and tendons for our overall health.

Let's now talk about our brain.
