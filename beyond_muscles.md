# Beyond Muscles

#####Physical activity is a popular mantra. 

Get Strong. Build Muscles. Stay healthy. 

Over the years, we have raised consciousness about the  importance of being active and about regular exercise. These messages are useful but we want to evolve and bring this mantra a little further.

To go further, we have to reach our joints, ligaments and our deep tissue.

Why is this important ? Health and personal energy. 

We all started life physically loosen. A baby can touch its heels on the back of its skull if needed.  

Progressively we build some body tension by growing up. As we grow older and older, we get stiffer and curbed by life. 

What is getting stiffer and curbed ? Our joints, ligaments, tendons and the deep tissue. 

Ask any elderly person and they will often confirm: their pain is on the joints, tendons and ligaments. 

The muscles? They work fine.

The idea of keeping our joints and ligaments healthier is a sustainable concern. It has important future consequences for our health and range of motion. 

For a developer, this is even more important. We don't need to get older to have physical problems related to joints, tendons and ligaments: 

Tendonitis, Dupuytrens, Carpal Tunnel, Bulge Disks, back pain and etc.  We can develop any of these problems after some years of coding.  

Joints and ligaments are so important that our body is often trying to protect them. This is probably due to our survival. Back in the savanna, to have a problem on a joint or a ligament made us an easy pray. 

Who is the guardian keeping joints and ligaments safe? Muscles.

Among other things, muscles try their best to protect our joints and ligaments from bending or stretching over a certain limit. 

If our body make such effort to protect our joints or ligaments, why do we have problems later on? 

The point here is that muscles keep our joints and ligaments in a constrict range of motion. If we don't challenge that, year after year this range gets shorter, toxins accumulate and we end up stiff and curbed.  

Is there a safe way to open our joints and ligaments further? 
Yes. But we need to go beyond our muscles.

There are specific techniques that will put our body to challenge our joints and ligaments with comfort and safety.  

Some forms of Yoga are specifically target to our deep tissue. They increase circulation by opening our joints and ligaments gently and securely. 

Imagine yourself as a developer *Homo erectus* at 90 years old. No joints, discs, tendons or ligaments problems. 

The muscles ? They work fine. 

The Sustainable Developer is concern on transforming her working hours into a 'health bank' for her joints, ligaments and deep tissue. 

We will discuss the best postures and ideas to positively impact the developer's daily life in the Second Part of this book. 

As for now, keep vivid the importance of going beyond our muscles into our deep tissue. 

It will pay off.
