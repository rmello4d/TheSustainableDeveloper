# Beyond Muscles

####Physical activity is a popular mantra. 

Get Strong. Build Muscles. Stay healthy. 

These messages are great and we have raised the level of consciousness over the years about this subject. 

Now is time to evolve and bring this mantra a little further.

To go further, we have to reach our joints, ligaments and our deep tissue. 

Just to clarify, we use our joints and ligaments while exercising.  

The question here is, how much are we using them ? 

Evolution kept joints and ligaments's motion between a certain security range. The reason for that is probably survival. Having a joint or ligament problem could have a devastating impact in our movement. We would be a much easier pray. 

Who is the guardian keeping our joints and ligaments in a secure range?  Muscles.

Muscles will protect, secure and make sure your joints and ligaments do not bend or strecht over a certain limit. They carry luggage as well.  

The mechanics is logical and makes sense right? Why should we bring our joints or ligaments even further? 

We start life physically loosen. A baby can touch its heels on the back of its skull if needed.  Slowly and surely we build some body tension by growing up. As we grow older and older, we also get stiffer and curbed by life. 

Ask any elderly person and they will probably confirm: the pain is on the joints, tendons and ligaments. The muscles ? They work fine. 

To make our joints and ligaments healthier is a sustainable concern, it has important future consequences. 

Is there a safe way to open and bring more flow and circulation to our joints and ligaments ? Yes. 

If we understand this technique, we will bring healthy benefits to our joints, ligaments and tendons. On top of that, it is a technique that save us personal energy on our daily working life. 

Think about the developer *Homo erectus* at 90 years old. All our working years as a health bank for our joints and ligaments. 

As for now, lets keep vivid the importantce of going beyond our muscles. It will pay off.
