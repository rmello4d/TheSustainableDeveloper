# Beyond Muscles

#####Physical activity is a popular mantra. 

Get Strong. Build Muscles. Stay healthy. 

Over the years, we as a society have raised consciousness about the  importance of being active and about exercising our body. These messages are useful. 

Although exercising is important, to obtain maximum performance developers need to reach their joints, ligaments, tendons and cartilages. 

Why is this crucial?  

We all started life flexible. A baby can touch its heels on the back of its head if needed.  

Progressively we build tension in our body. As we grow older and older we get stiffer and stiffer, bent by life. 

What is getting stiffer? Joints, ligaments, tendons and cartilages

Ask any elderly person and they will often confirm: their pain is on the joints, tendons and ligaments. 

The muscles? They work fine.

The practice of keeping our joints and ligaments healthier has major impacts in our health. 

Developers don't need to get older to show physical problems related to joints, tendons and ligaments: 

Tendonitis, Dupuytrens, Carpal Tunnel, Bulge Disks, back pain and etc.  Developers can have any of these problems after some years of coding.  

Joints and ligaments are so important that our body is often trying to overprotect them. Who is the guardian keeping joints and ligaments safe? Muscles.

Among other things, muscles try their best to protect our joints and ligaments from bending or stretching over a certain limit. 

If our muscles are protecting our joints and ligaments, why we often have problems later in life? 

The important idea is that muscles keep our joints and ligaments under a protected and limited range of motion. Safety is the body main concern. 

If we don't challenge it, year after year this range gets shorter, toxins accumulate and we end up stiffer and stiffer. 

Is there a safe way to open our joints and ligaments further? Yes. Guess what ? There is a specific branch of Yoga for that. 

This Yoga technique challenges the joints in a  different way. It is not about strenght, it is about release and trust. Nonetheless, these techniques increase circulation by opening our joints and ligaments gently and safely. 

Imagine yourself as a developer *Homo erectus* at 90 years old. No joints, discs, tendons or ligaments problems. 

We will discuss these techniques to positively impact the daily life of developers in the Second Part of the book. 

To become a Sustainable Developer,  we need to transform our working hours into a 'health bank' for our joints, ligaments and deep tissue. 

As for now, keep vivid the importance of our joints, ligaments and tendons for our overall health.

Let's now talk about our brain.
