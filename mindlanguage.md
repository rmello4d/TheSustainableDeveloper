#The Roar Language

#####Lets go back not too far, about 2 million years ago.

Visualize earth as a wild place, no buildings, no cars, no civilization. A magnificent blue planet just governed by cruel jungle law.

In that scene, you are one of our descendants, a homo habilis. You just left your group of about 30 people together with 8 other tribal members. 

We will be looking for sharp stones to make spears in the savanna. Also, there was no grammatical language available. You are using primal sounds to communicate among your hairy friends. 

After 10 mins walking,  the small group reach a vast open area, peacefully looking for perfect stones. 

Not far from there, a salivating and hungry lion is approaching the group.

As it goes, one of us is about to die.

The king of the jungle charges from a long distance on pure instincts and power.

You are the first to notice the attack. You howl with all our lungs to alarm everybody.

Panic.

By chance, you know exactly how to escape. 10 mins before you made a turn and saw a safe place hidden in the savanna, certainly not accessible by the lion.

Everybody could be saved if they knew precisely how to get in this place. You try to yell everybody but your friends cannot understand precisely your primal sounds.

You got to the safe place but, seconds later, one of the members is caught.

The lion roars victory.

Slowly, the brutal scene fades down and the savanna returns to the superficial calmness.

Later, you regroup at your campsite, one friend is missing.

Unfortunately, with no structured language and without words, no exact explanations are possible. Little can be said to the other 29 members about the savanna tragedy.

Also, in 2 months we will not be able to say “Do you remember Jay ? the guy killed by the lion 2 months ago ?”, “Yes! Jay, I miss him, he was a good man”.

Without language, there are no viable way to represent past or future. Without language our brain is mostly instincts and emotions. If we could go back 2 million years ago, we would be a “here and now” creature. Like the lion.   

Language is fundamental and probably one of the most powerful tools in human history.  

It changed us forever but it has a high cost. Lets get into the bill.
