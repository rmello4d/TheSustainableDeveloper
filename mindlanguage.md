#The Roar Language

#####Lets go back not too far, about 2 million years ago.

Visualize earth as a wild place, no buildings, no cars, no civilization. A magnificent blue planet just governed by cruel jungle law.

In that scene, you are one of our descendants, a homo habilis. You just left your group of about 30 people together with 8 other tribal members. 

We will be looking for sharp stones to make spears in the savanna. Also, there was no grammatical language available. You are using primal sounds to communicate among your hairy friends. 

After 10 mins walking,  the small group reach a vast open area, peacefully looking for perfect stones. 

Not far from there, a salivating and hungry lion is approaching the group.

As it goes, one of us is about to die.

The king of the jungle charges from a long distance on pure instincts and power.

You are the first to notice the attack. You howl with all our lungs to alarm everybody.

Panic.

By chance, you know exactly how to escape because 10 mins before you made a turn and saw a safe place hidden in the savanna. This place was certainly not accessible by the lion.

Everybody could be saved. You try to yell but your friends cannot understand precisely your primal sounds.

As it goes, you manage to escape and reach the safe place but, seconds later, one of your friends is caught.

The lion roars victory.

Slowly, the brutal scene fades down and the savanna returns to the superficial calmness.

Later, you regroup at your campsite, one friend is missing.

Unfortunately, with no structured language and without words, no exact explanations were possible. Little can be said to the other 29 members about the savanna tragedy.

Also, in 2 months you will not be able to say “Do you remember Jay ? the guy killed by the lion 2 months ago ?”, “Yes! Jay, I miss him, he was a good man”.

Without language, there are no representation of the past or future. Without language our brain is mostly instincts and emotions. If you could go back 2 million years ago, you would be a “here and now” creature. Like the lion.   

Language is fundamental and probably one of the most powerful tools in human history.  

It changed us forever but also has a high cost. Lets get into the bill.
