#The Mind Language

Using our imagination, lets go back 4 million years ago.

Visualize earth as a wild place, no buildings, no cars, no civilization. A magnificent blue planet just governed by cruel jungle law.

In that scene, we are one of our descendants, a homo habilis. 
We just left our group of about 30 people to adventure the savanna looking for a sharp stone to make a new spear. With us, 8 other tribal members. 

Without a structured language, we use primal sounds to communicate with our hairy buds.  

After 10 mins we reach a vast open area and all the members are looking for perfect stones. 

Not far from there,  a salivating and hungry lion is approaching your group.

As it goes, one of you is about to die.

The king of the jungle charges from a long distance on pure instincts and power.

You are the first to notice the lion’s attack and howl with all your lung capacity to alarm everybody.

Panic.

By chance, you know exactly how to escape because  10 mins ago you made a turn and saw a safe hidden place, certainly not accessible by the lion.

Everybody could be saved if they knew precisely about this place. You try to scream desperately to everybody but your friends, in panic,  don’t understand your primal sounds.

Few dozen seconds later, one of your friends is caught.

The lion roars victory.

Slowly, the brutal scene fades down and the savanna returns to the superficial calmness.

Later you regroup at your campsite: One friend is missing.

Unfortunately, with no structured language and without words, no  exact explanations are possible. Little can be explained to the other 30 members of your group about the savanna event.

Without a structured language, even memory is compromised. You cannot just say “Do you remember Jay ? the guy eaten by the lion 2 months ago ?”, “Yes! Jay, I miss him, he was a good man”.

Without language, even memory gets lost.  

No structured language means: basic instincts and emotions rule your life and, if you could go back 4 billion years ago,  you would be mostly a “here and now” creature.  

After all, by that time, you were like a Lion, no past or future, a brain guided solely by instincts and emotions.  

I am exaggerating this story to folklore how language was important in our evolution. Of course, as you know there has been always some kind of communication around us: sounds, gestures, tools and cave paintings to help us understand nature or to show a past event. 

But mostly, without a structured language, we were animals pretty much as any other, no real big advantages dealing with jungle law.  

Yes, a structured language is fundamental and probably the most powerful tool in human history.  It changed us forever.

If you can organically understand how a structured language gave us the jump from beasts to mankind, a whole new possibility to explore your mind would be possible because language became one of the key elements of your mind.
