#The Mind Language

Using our imagination, lets go back 4 million years ago.

Visualize earth as a wild place, no buildings, no cars, no civilization. A magnificent blue planet just governed by cruel jungle law.

In that scene, we are one of our descendants, a homo habilis. 
We just left our group of about 30 people to adventure the savanna looking for a sharp stone to make a new spear. With us, 8 other tribal members. 

Without a structured language, we use primal sounds to communicate with our hairy friends.  

After 10 mins we reach a vast open area and all the members are peacefully looking for perfect stones. 

Not far from there, a salivating and hungry lion is approaching our group.

As it goes, one of us is about to die.

The king of the jungle charges from a long distance on pure instincts and power.

We are the first to notice the lion’s attack and howl with all our lung capacity to alarm everybody.

Panic.

By chance, we know exactly how to escape. 10 mins ago we made a turn and saw a safe hidden place, certainly not accessible by the lion.

Everybody could be saved if they knew precisely about this place. We try to scream desperately to everybody but our friends, in panic,  don’t understand our primal sounds.

Few seconds later, one of our friends is caught.

The lion roars victory.

Slowly, the brutal scene fades down and the savanna returns to the superficial calmness.

Later we regroup at our campsite, one friend is missing.

Unfortunately, with no structured language and without words, no exact explanations are possible. Little can be said to the other 29 members about the savanna tragedy.

Also, in 2 months we cannot say “Do you remember Jay ? the guy eaten by the lion 2 months ago ?”, “Yes! Jay, I miss him, he was a good man”.

Without language, we were like a Lion, no past or future, a brain guided solely by instincts and emotions. If we could go back 4 billion years ago, we would be a “here and now” creature.  

Language is fundamental and probably one of the most powerful tools in human history.  

It changed us forever.
