#The Mind Language

Using our imagination, lets go back 4 million years ago.

Visualize earth as a wild place, no buildings, no cars, no civilization. A magnificent blue planet just governed by cruel jungle law.

In that scene, we are one of our descendants, a homo habilis. 
We just left our group of about 30 people to adventure the savanna looking for a sharp stone to make a new spear. With us, 8 other tribal members. 

Without a structured language, we use primal sounds to communicate with our hairy friends.  

After 10 mins we reach a vast open area and all the members are peacefully looking for perfect stones. 

Not far from there, a salivating and hungry lion is approaching our group.

As it goes, one of us is about to die.

The king of the jungle charges from a long distance on pure instincts and power.

We are the first to notice the lion’s attack and howl with all our lung capacity to alarm everybody.

Panic.

By chance, we know exactly how to escape. 10 mins ago we made a turn and saw a safe hidden place, certainly not accessible by the lion.

Everybody could be saved if they knew precisely about this place. We try to scream desperately to everybody but our friends, in panic,  don’t understand our primal sounds.

Few seconds later, one of our friends is caught.

The lion roars victory.

Slowly, the brutal scene fades down and the savanna returns to the superficial calmness.

Later we regroup at our campsite: One friend is missing.

Unfortunately, with no structured language and without words, no  exact explanations are possible. Little can be said to the other 29 members about the savanna tragedy.

Without a structured language we cannot say “Do you remember Jay ? the guy eaten by the lion 2 months ago ?”, “Yes! Jay, I miss him, he was a good man”.

Without language, even memory gets lost.  

Not having a structured language means basic instincts and emotions rule our life. If we could go back 4 billion years ago, we would be mostly a “here and now” creature.  

After all, we were like a Lion, no past or future, a brain guided solely by instincts and emotions.  

I am exaggerating this story to folklore how language was important in our evolution. Of course, as you know there has been always some kind of communication around us: sounds, gestures, tools and cave paintings to help us understand nature or to show a past event. 

But mostly, without a structured language, we were animals pretty much as any other, no real big advantages dealing with jungle law.  

Yes, a structured language is fundamental and probably the most powerful tool in human history.  It changed us forever.

If you can organically understand how a structured language gave us the jump from beasts to mankind, a whole new possibility to explore your mind would be possible because language became one of the key elements of your mind.
