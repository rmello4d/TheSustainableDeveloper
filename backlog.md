Is it true that if we relax our mind we consume less energy ? Yes. We do that everyday at sleep, for example. 

What happens when we sleep? We rest. 

How do we rest ? By not moving and by taking our mind to a dreamy state. Studies (*) confirm that our brain uses about 25% less oxygen while in deep sleep. 

If at sleep the brain and the muscles are not consuming as much oxygen, to where is all that unused breathing oxygen going ? 

Everywhere else. Organs, tissues, cells...

After sleeping for 8 hours we feel recharged. Our whole body gets oxygenated and replenished.

Your brain is a reality engine. evolution is about having kids, it is not about finding the truth. 

In game theory, simulations with automatas that see the truth, never survive. The automatas that see the interface (a fake visual from the source) have higher chances to survive. 

Interface gives you adaptable behaviour. Our perceptions is like that.

Current models of visual perception typically assume that human vision estimates true properties of physical objects, properties that exist even if unperceived. However, recent studies of perceptual evolution, using evolutionary games and genetic algorithms, reveal that natural selection often drives true perceptions to extinction when they compete with perceptions tuned to fitness rather than truth: Perception guides adaptive behavior; it does not estimate a preexisting physical truth. 
Moreover, shifting from evolutionary biology to quantum physics, there is reason to disbelieve in preexisting physical truths: Certain interpretations of quantum theory deny that dynamical properties of physical objects have definite values when unobserved. In some of these interpretations the observer is fundamental.
These two considerations, from evolutionary biology and quantum physics, suggest that current models of object perception require fundamental reformulation.

First, there is no free information. For every bit of information one obtains about the external world, one must pay a price in energy, e.g., in calories expended to obtain, process and retain that information. And for every calorie expended in perception, one must go out and kill something and eat it to get that calorie. So natural selection tends to favor perceptual systems that, ceteris paribus, use fewer calories. One way to use fewer calories is to see less truth, especially truth that is not informative about fitness.

Second, for every bit of information one obtains about the external world, one must pay a price in time. More information requires, in general, more time to obtain and process. But in the real world where predators are on the prowl and prey must be wary, the race is often to the swift. It is the slower gazelle that becomes lunch for the swifter cheetah. So natural selection tends to favor perceptual systems that, ceteris paribus, take less time. One way to take less time is, again, to see less truth, especially truth that is not informative about fitness.

Third, in a world where organisms are adapted to niches and require homeostatic mechanisms, the fitness functions guiding their evolution are generally not monotonic functions of structures or quantities in the world. Too much salt or too little can be devastating; something in between is just right for fitness. The same goldilocks principle can hold for water, altitude, humidity, and so on. In these cases, perceptions that are tuned to fitness are ipso facto not tuned to the true structure of the world, because the two are not monotonically related; knowing the truth is not just irrelevant, it can be inimical, to fitness.

Fourth, in the generic case where noise and uncertainty are endemic to the perceptual process, a strategy that estimates a true state of the world and then uses the utility associated to that state to govern its decisions must throw away valuable information about utility. It will in general be driven to extinction by a strategy that does not estimate the true state of the world, and instead uses all the information about utility (Marion, 2013).

Fifth, more complex perceptual systems are more difficult to evolve. Monte Carlo simulations of genetic algorithms show that there is a combinatorial explosion in the complexity of the search required to evolve more complex perceptual systems. This combinatorial explosion itself is a selection pressure toward simpler perceptual systems.

In short, natural selection does not favor perceptual systems that see the truth in whole or in part. Instead, it favors perceptions that are fast, cheap, and tailored to guide behaviors needed to survive and reproduce. Perception is not about truth, it's about having kids. Genes coding for perceptual systems that increase the probability of having kids are ipso facto the genes that are more likely to code for perceptual systems in the next generation.

***

Turning now to apply the interface metaphor to human perception, the idea is that natural selection has not shaped our perceptions to be insights into the true structure and causal nature of objective reality, but has instead shaped our perceptions to be a species-specific user interface, fashioned to guide the behaviors that we need to survive and reproduce. Space and time are the desktop of our perceptual interface, and three-dimensional objects are icons on that desktop.

evolution has shaped us with a species-specific interface whose icons we must take seriously. If there is a cliff, don't step over. If there is a cobra, don't grab its tail. Natural selection has endowed us with perceptions that function to guide adaptive behaviors, and we ignore them at our own peril.

If you walk to the major cities of US, Canada and Europe you will confirm that Yoga is now popular, fashion, it has hundreds of postures and tons of studios.

Does our imaginary Yogi practice Yoga ? Yes, but probably not today’s Yoga.

Yoga is now popular, fashioned, it has hundreds of postures, tons of studios. Today’s Yoga is mainly about exercising muscles. 

Is that bad?  Not at all. Should you sign up for the next Bikram Yoga class? Maybe. 

Let’s first  understand some Yoga  history in a super fast pace:

The oldest Yoga artifact has about 6000 years old, it is the image of a person in lotus position.  Much much later, about 5000 years after, in the first written book of yogis called the Yoga Sutras a few group of simple postures were mentioned. In fact, these few postures represent a very small portion of the Yoga Sutras. Yoga was not about physical exercises. In fact, only about two hundred years ago, mainly provoked by western influences, the number of postures skyrocketed. 

What am I saying ? Is Yoga getting bad ? No. The point here is to note that muscles are not the goal, so if you practice any form of Yoga, football or baseball, great! These are all muscular based exercises.

Many strategies and theories have been said and proposed about controlling your mind and brain.

As you know, the media and some people try to convince us that controlling your brain is important, the ultimatum goal to make your life perfect.

Is it really ?
Is it even possible to control it ?


[chapter one] Can you control your brain ?

No.

The brain was not meant or designed to be "controlled".

And in fact, you can’t. Our brain is like an ocean receiving all the flowing rivers from the senses and that is not part of your decisions. You can see your brain as a "super recorder" running in a forever 'on' mode.

Your brain registers everything you touch, listen, see, taste, smell, eat... Even when you sleep your brain is active. Think of a black hole grabbing and absorbing everything within range of your sensory boundaries. Nothing escapes.

On top of that, the brain is wired to regulate the activities in your body, from hormones delivery to blood circulation.

Bottom line: the brain is a vital organ and nature was smart enough to take the control off your hands. Do you control your heart ? Your liver ? No, and that is a good thing. Vital organs are self regulated, independent of your control and the brain falls in that category.

So, your brain is not your puppet.   It is an organ too complex, powerful and designed to go beyond your consciousness.

Having said that, if we can't control it, what's all the fuss about it ?


[Chapter 2] The game between brain and mind.

The distinction between brain and mind is important. As previously discussed,  your brain cannot be controlled and that is probably a good thing.

How about your mind ? Is controlling your mind different than controlling your brain ?

To begin with, lets realize that brain and mind are understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Philosophy, psychology, religion and science will give you different answers. By consequence, trying to define with precision is counter productive, it will be out of our scope to impose a definition that can settle the different views but, it is possible to give some context that will help to create an organic way of understanding the mind and brain relation:

In the context of this book, the mind is the brain susceptible to some control.

To be more precise, concepts such as awareness, consciousness, memory, thoughts, reasoning and judgments fall in that category. You have some control over theses brain functions.

Take your memory for example, to some extent, memory is an area of your brain that you can apply some control: Can you remember some of the things that happened with you yesterday? Hopefully yes.

Just to clarify, I am not saying that just the controllable part of your memory is your mind.  The memory you can't control or access entirely is also part of your mind. The whole memory package is important for the mind.

To give you the opposite example, could you tell me the last time you ordered a signal to your adrenal glands to produce more cortisone ? No, such a thing is not your decision or susceptible to control, therefore not in your mind.

This simple and organic idea of the mind consisting of brain areas susceptible to some control opens a wonderful environment to work in.

Lets now understand some of the key elements of your mind.

[chapter 3] The Mind Language

I need your imagination to go back 4 million years ago. Let’s visualize earth as a wild place, no buildings, no cars, no civilization. A magnificent blue planet just governed by cruel jungle law.

In that scene, you are one of our descendants, a homo habilis. You just left your group of about 30 people to adventure the savanna looking for a sharp stone to make a new spear. With you, 8 other tribal members. 

Here an important detail: You have no structured language yet, just primal sounds to communicate with your peers.  

After 10 mins you reach a vast open area and all the members are looking for perfect stones. 

Not far from there,  a salivating and hungry lion is approaching your group.

As it goes, one of you is about to die.

The king of the jungle charges from a long distance on pure instincts and power.

You are the first to notice the lion’s attack and howl with all your lung capacity to alarm everybody.

Panic.

By chance, you know exactly how to escape because  10 mins ago you made a turn and saw a safe hidden place, certainly not accessible by the lion.

Everybody could be saved if they knew precisely about this place. You try to scream desperately to everybody but your friends, in panic,  don’t understand your primal sounds.

Few dozen seconds later, one of your friends is caught.

The lion roars victory.

Slowly, the brutal scene fades down and the savanna returns to the superficial calmness.

Later you regroup at your campsite: One friend is missing.

Unfortunately, with no structured language and without words, no  exact explanations are possible. Little can be explained to the other 30 members of your group about the savanna event.

Without a structured language, even memory is compromised. You cannot just say “Do you remember Jay ? the guy eaten by the lion 2 months ago ?”, “Yes! Jay, I miss him, he was a good man”.

Without language, even memory gets lost.  

No structured language means: basic instincts and emotions rule your life and, if you could go back 4 billion years ago,  you would be mostly a “here and now” creature.  

After all, by that time, you were like a Lion, no past or future, a brain guided solely by instincts and emotions.  

I am exaggerating this story to folklore how language was important in our evolution. Of course, as you know there has been always some kind of communication around us: sounds, gestures, tools and cave paintings to help us understand nature or to show a past event. 

But mostly, without a structured language, we were animals pretty much as any other, no real big advantages dealing with jungle law.  

Yes, a structured language is fundamental and probably the most powerful tool in human history.  It changed us forever.

If you can organically understand how a structured language gave us the jump from beasts to mankind, a whole new possibility to explore your mind would be possible because language became one of the key elements of your mind.



[Chapter 4]  One word after the other

Language was a magical tool and our brain was thirsty for it. As a result, we went crazy naming everything we could: objects, actions, places, emotions … Everything meaningful around us got baptised.

Now let’s go further and understand how humans may express structured languages: through our vocal chords, our brain or by writing (which came later on to mankind):

In the vocal chords we have the  birthplace of the manifested  word. Someday someone said for the first time a sound and, purposely linked that sound to a particular meaning.  

By repetition, others reproduced the same sound and meaning.

This appears to be very elementary and other animals are also capable of the same: creating meaningful sounds.

But, for us humans, a magical second step happened: we were able to say the same sound in our brain without using our vocal chords.

What a great magical trick !

The concatenation of meaningful  sounds in your head created something very special:  a continuous flow of images and ideas. Let’s call it Thinking.  

And how does Thinking operate in your head ?  

One sound after the other.  

You think by putting  sounds of your known language one after the other in your head. 

Notice that this is different than Imagination. With imagination we are putting images one after the other, creating a cinema effect inside your head. 

Let’s give some context by saying that thinking is yourself telling a story inside your brain in your known language.

If you have no clue about the sounds of mandarin language for example, to think in mandarin is quite impossible, isn’t?

Also, Thinking does not accept simultaneous action:  you cannot think 2 stories at the exactly same time in your head.

Sure you can tell and hold 2 or more stories in your head but you will be switching from one to the other really quick. Here an example, try these 2 phrases:

I am super-man
Your head is big

Can you say  both phrases in your head at exactly same time ?

No.

One of our great inventions, structured language,  has also some limits despite the fact our brain can process things in parallel (right now for example you are reading, listening and probably regulating your hormonal levels at the same time).

If the brain can process things in parallel, why it is not  capable of thinking 5 different things at the same exact time ? 

For now, keep in mind that language has the property of being dominant, dictatorial and extremely powerful inside your head. No parallelism is possible.

We think by putting one sound after the other.



[chapter 5] How vast is your language ?

Can a new born baby think ? 

Yes, but just through images. 

This is obvious since babies take time to acquire words and their meanings. 

Until they learn their first words (which will take about 12 months)  babies are very much connected to the “here and now”. No structured language means no past, no future,  just few sounds and open eyes looking everything, completely submerged in the moment. 

What a special period, a little cute beast.  

With 18 months, children tipically learn between 50 and 100 words. These words are scattered to the simple things they like or need. 

At 24 months they may already accumulate a vocabulary of 200 to 300 words, quickly jumping to a 1000 one year later. 
By 5 and 7 they have an expressive vocabulary of 3000 to 5000 words. 
An adult may reach 40,000 words and we estimate that English speaking University students tend to be around 40-60,000 words. 





A child ? how many words ?
An adult ?
A phd ?
Russian ?
Chinese ?
English ?

Children typically speak their first word somewhere around 12 months. Some children, however, take up to 16 months to utter that long-awaited first word and this is still considered to be within the range of typical.
At 18 months, children typically use between 50 and 100 words (but we don't worry too much unless they have fewer than 20).
At 24 months, children usually have an expressive vocabulary of 200-300 words (but we don't worry too much unless they have fewer than 50).
At 3 years, children can have anywhere from 500-1,100 words in their vocabulary.
By 5-7 years, children have an expressive vocabulary of 3000-5000 words.

 adult : its around 30,000-40,000

The estimates for English speaking University students tend to be around 40-60,000 words,










Sounds that later became written words inside your head without vocal chord involvement. 

Stop to think about this magical process. 



Trash

4 billion years ago, long before we invented structured language, you could maybe explain to your group of 30 hunters that tomorrow you want to go fishing. You would probably use some gesturing, calling and mimicking, spending lots of energy making sure everybody understood. 

In a structured language environment, the job could be done with a simple  “Tomorrow we go fishing” and everybody understood well  what you want. What a great energy saver! 
 








 






 







(trash)

This definition is not meant to be the last word about the subject, our goal is just to give you a logical way to differentiate brain and mind in order to better understand
You have some control of your thoughts or your reasoning. and they could influence the quality of your life.
If mind is the brain susceptible to control, how much control is possible ?
[chapter 3]
Under the Influence
around the world people communicate with one another using a dazzling array of languages—7,000 or so all told—and each language requires very different things from its speakers. For example, suppose I want to tell you that I saw Uncle Vanya on 42nd Street. In Mian, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, the verb I used would reveal whether the event happened just now, yesterday or in the distant past, whereas in Indonesian, the verb wouldn’t even give away whether it had already happened or was still coming up. In Russian, the verb would reveal my gender. In Mandarin, I would have to specify whether the titular uncle is maternal or paternal and whether he is related by blood or marriage, because there are different words for all these different types of uncles and then some (he happens to be a mother’s brother, as the Chinese translation clearly states). And in Pirahã, a language spoken in the Amazon, I couldn’t say “42nd,” because there are no words for exact numbers, just words for “few” and “many.”
Languages differ from one another in innumerable ways, but just because people talk differently does not necessarily mean they think differently. How can we tell whether speakers of Mian, Russian, Indonesian, Mandarin or Pirahã actually end up attending to, remembering and reasoning about the world in different ways because of the languages they speak? Research in my lab and in many others has been uncovering how language shapes even the most fundamental dimensions of human experience: space, time, causality and relationships to others.
Let us return to Pormpuraaw. Unlike English, the Kuuk Thaayorre language spoken in Pormpuraaw does not use relative spatial terms such as left and right. Rather Kuuk Thaayorre speakers talk in terms of absolute cardinal directions (north, south, east, west, and so forth). Of course, in English we also use cardinal direction terms but only for large spatial scales. We would not say, for example, “They set the salad forks southeast of the dinner forks—the philistines!” But in Kuuk Thaayorre cardinal directions are used at all scales. This means one ends up saying things like “the cup is southeast of the plate” or “the boy standing to the south of Mary is my brother.” In Pormpuraaw, one must always stay oriented, just to be able to speak properly.
Moreover, groundbreaking work conducted by Stephen C. Levinson of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and John B. Haviland of the University of California, San Diego, over the past two decades has demonstrated that people who speak languages that rely on absolute directions are remarkably good at keeping track of where they are, even in unfamiliar landscapes or inside unfamiliar buildings. They do this better than folks who live in the same environments but do not speak such languages and in fact better than scientists thought humans ever could. The requirements of their languages enforce and train this cognitive prowess.
People who think differently about space are also likely to think differently about time. For example, my colleague Alice Gaby of the University of California, Berkeley, and I gave Kuuk Thaayorre speakers sets of pictures that showed temporal progressions—a man aging, a crocodile growing, a banana being eaten. We then asked them to arrange the shuffled photographs on the ground to indicate the correct temporal order.
We tested each person twice, each time facing in a different cardinal direction. English speakers given this task will arrange the cards so that time proceeds from left to right. Hebrew speakers will tend to lay out the cards from right to left. This shows that writing direction in a language influences how we organize time. The Kuuk Thaayorre, however, did not routinely arrange the cards from left to right or right to left. They arranged them from east to west. That is, when they were seated facing south, the cards went left to right. When they faced north, the cards went from right to left. When they faced east, the cards came toward the body, and so on. We never told anyone which direction they were facing—the Kuuk Thaayorre knew that already and spontaneously used this spatial orientation to construct their representations of time.
Representations of time vary in many other ways around the world. For example, English speakers consider the future to be “ahead” and the past “behind.” In 2010 Lynden Miles of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and his colleagues discovered that English speakers unconsciously sway their bodies forward when thinking about the future and back when thinking about the past. But in Aymara, a language spoken in the Andes, the past is said to be in front and the future behind. And the Aymara speakers’ body language matches their way of talking: in 2006 Raphael Núñez of U.C.S.D. and Eve Sweetser of U.C. Berkeley found that Aymara gesture in front of them when talking about the past and behind them when discussing the future.
remembering whodunit
speakers of different languages also differ in how they describe events and, as a result, how well they can remember who did what. All events, even split-second accidents, are complicated and require us to construe and interpret what happened. Take, for example, former vice president Dick Cheney’s quail-hunting accident, in which he accidentally shot Harry Whittington. One could say that “Cheney shot Whittington” (wherein Cheney is the direct cause), or “Whittington got shot by Cheney” (distancing Cheney from the outcome), or “Whittington got peppered pretty good” (leaving Cheney out altogether). Cheney himself said “Ultimately I’m the guy who pulled the trigger that fired the round that hit Harry,” interposing a long chain of events between himself and the outcome. President George Bush’s take—“he heard a bird flush, and he turned and pulled the trigger and saw his friend get wounded”—was an even more masterful exculpation, transforming Cheney from agent to mere witness in less than a sentence.
The American public is rarely impressed with such linguistic wiggling because nonagentive language sounds evasive in English, the province of guilt-shirking children and politicians. English speakers tend to phrase things in terms of people doing things, preferring transitive constructions like “John broke the vase” even for accidents. Speakers of Japanese or Spanish, in contrast, are less likely to mention the agent when describing an accidental event. In Spanish one might say “Se rompió el florero,” which translates to “the vase broke” or “the vase broke itself.”
My student Caitlin M. Fausey and I have found that such linguistic differences influence how people construe what happened and have consequences for eyewitness memory. In our studies, published in 2010, speakers of English, Spanish and
Japanese watched videos of two guys popping balloons, breaking eggs and spilling drinks either intentionally or accidentally. Later we gave them a surprise memory test. For each event they had witnessed, they had to say which guy did it, just like in a police line-up. Another group of English, Spanish and Japanese speakers described the same events. When we looked at the memory data, we found exactly the differences in eyewitness memory predicted by patterns in language. Speakers of all three languages described intentional events agentively, saying things such as “He popped the balloon,” and all three groups remembered who did these intentional actions equally well. When it came to accidents, however, interesting differences emerged. Spanish and Japanese speakers were less likely to describe the accidents agentively than were English speakers, and they correspondingly remembered who did it less well than English speakers did. This was not because they had poorer memory overall—they remembered the agents of intentional events (for which their languages would naturally mention the agent) just as well as English speakers did.
Not only do languages influence what we remember, but the structures of languages can make it easier or harder for us to learn new things. For instance, because the number words in some languages reveal the underlying base-10 structure more transparently than do the number words in English (there are no troublesome teens like 11 or 13 in Mandarin, for instance), kids learning those languages are able to learn the base-10 insight sooner. And depending on how many syllables the number words have, it will be easier or harder to keep a phone number in mind or to do mental calculation. Language can even affect how quickly children figure out whether they are male or female. In 1983 Alexander Guiora of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor compared three groups of kids growing up with Hebrew, English or Finnish as their native language. Hebrew marks gender prolifically (even the word “you” is different depending on gender), Finnish has no gender marking and English is somewhere in between. Accordingly, children growing up in a Hebrew-speaking environment figure out their own gender about a year earlier than Finnish-speaking children; English-speaking kids fall in the middle.
what shapes what?
These are just some of the many fascinating findings of cross-linguistic differences in cognition. But how do we know whether differences in language create differences in thought, or the other way around? The answer, it turns out, is both—the way we think influences the way we speak, but the influence also goes the other way. The past decade has seen a host of ingenious demonstrations establishing that language indeed plays a causal role in shaping cognition. Studies have shown that changing how people talk changes how they think. Teaching people new color words, for instance, changes their ability to discriminate colors. And teaching people a new way of talking about time gives them a new way of thinking about it.
Another way to get at this question is to study people who are fluent in two languages. Studies have shown that bilinguals change how they see the world depending on which language they are speaking. Two sets of findings published in 2010 demonstrate that even something as fundamental as who you like and do not like depends on the language in which you are asked. The studies, one by Oludamini Ogunnaike and his colleagues at Harvard and another by Shai Danziger and his colleagues at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, looked at Arabic-French bilinguals in Morocco, Spanish-English bilinguals in the U.S. and Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals in Israel, in each case testing the participants’ implicit biases. For example, Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals were asked to quickly press buttons in response to words under various conditions. In one condition if they saw a Jewish name like “Yair” or a positive trait like “good” or “strong,” they were instructed to press “M,”; if they saw an Arab name like “Ahmed” or a negative trait like “mean” or “weak,” they were told to press “X.” In another condition the pairing was reversed so that Jewish names and negative traits shared a response key, and Arab names and positive traits shared a response key. The researchers measured how quickly subjects were able to respond under the two conditions. This task has been widely used to measure involuntary or automatic biases—how naturally things such as positive traits and ethnic groups seem to go together in people’s minds.
Surprisingly, the investigators found big shifts in these involuntary automatic biases in bilinguals depending on the language in which they were tested. The Arabic-Hebrew bilinguals, for their part, showed more positive implicit attitudes toward Jews when tested in Hebrew than when tested in Arabic.
Language also appears to be involved in many more aspects of our mental lives than scientists had previously supposed. People rely on language even when doing simple things like distinguishing patches of color, counting dots on a screen or orienting in a small room: my colleagues and I have found that limiting people’s ability to access their language faculties fluently—by giving them a competing demanding verbal task such as repeating a news report, for instance—impairs their ability to perform these tasks. This means that the categories and distinctions that exist in particular languages are meddling in our mental lives very broadly. What researchers have been calling “thinking” this whole time actually appears to be a collection of both linguistic and nonlinguistic processes. As a result, there may not be a lot of adult human thinking where language does not play a role.
A hallmark feature of human intelligence is its adaptability, the ability to invent and rearrange conceptions of the world to suit changing goals and environments. One consequence of this flexibility is the great diversity of languages that have emerged around the globe. Each provides its own cognitive toolkit and encapsulates the knowledge and worldview developed over thousands of years within a culture. Each contains a way of perceiving, categorizing and making meaning in the world, an invaluable guidebook developed and honed by our ancestors. Research into how the languages we speak shape the way we think is helping scientists to unravel how we create knowledge and construct reality and how we got to be as smart and sophisticated as we are. And this insight, in turn, helps us understand the very essence of what makes us human.
To go even further, we need to explore the viplain in one paragraph about the history behind the yogic view.
You probably don't have full control, for example, of your judgments or your thoughts, but in some extent you can control it if you want.
Why do you need to control your mind ?
After years of noncontinuous but passionate interest, I started to notice during workshops that people were giving me lots of feedback about what I was saying.
As of today, I can, in a delicate way, explain and carry collectively the subtle concepts behind this difficult subject. As a result, more understanding and subsequently calmness were established. People felt better.
