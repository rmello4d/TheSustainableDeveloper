# The Yogi Machine

##### Imagine a traditional picture of a Yogi : A beaming figure in lotus position. 

A life spent mastering himself. Everything else is not important. 

He can go days without much food or water. He can sit and meditate for hours. He may go to extremes to test his body, mind and soul. 

How about the beaming part ? After all, Yogis have been depicted with radiant beams of light. 

Lets have a closer look at our Yogi image:

**In lotus position a Yogi does not move.** 

He is balanced and relaxed. 

By not moving and by being at rest, a Yogi solves the first piece of our puzzle: muscles are big consumers of energy and oxygen in the body. 

Our muscles play a big role in all the energy we consume while awake. They use oxygen coming from our breathing to create energy. 

We all know instinticvely this relationship between muscle activity and breathing. If we try to sprint we will naturally increase our breathing frequency. We have to "catch our breath".  

Here a wild guess why muscles consume a lot of oxygen. Imagine you have a Lion chasing you. Your body will be screaming 'please get all energy possible to my muscles !'

In fact, our muscles devour oxygen when active: to move, stand, run, swimn, etc. Muscles are an intricate system, since we became bipedal a myriad of muscles is used to just keep up with gravity! 

From the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep, muscles are active and eating great part of the oxygen you breathe. Keeping in mind this important correlation of muscles, breath and energy consumption. 

**In lotus position a Yogi meditates.** 

Allow me to simplify the word meditation as the relaxing of your mind. We will go deeper into how that happens, but for now, please bare with me. 

A relaxed mind solves the second piece of our puzzle : the brain is another big consumer of energy and oxygen in the body. 

Is it possible to relax our mind and consume less oxygen ? Yes. We do that everyday at sleep. 

What happens when we sleep? We rest. How do we rest ? By not moving much and by taking our mind to a dreamy state. Studies (*) confirm that our brain uses about 25% less oxygen while in deep sleep. 

This brings an interesting question, if at sleep the brain and the muscles are not consuming as much oxygen, to where is all that unused breathing oxygen going ? 

Everywhere else. Organs, tissues, cells...

After sleeping for 8 hours we feel recharged.

Lets go back and imagine the Yogi. His posture is balanced. His muscles are relaxed. His brain is going layer by layer to a deep state of meditation.  His energy is not being wasted by bad posture, excessive muscular activity, worries or frenetic thinking. The Yogi is nourishing his organs, cells, tissues while awake.

He decides to breathe a notch up and get even more oxygen and energy. 

After awhile, he turns into those radiant beams of light. 

Yogis raise their own energy to an optimal state and by a sustainable practice, keep it there.  

Do we need to go in a cave for 20 years to learn that ? 

If your goal in life is to be Yogi, probably yes. Though, this is not our case. Can we take advantage of some of their techniques by applying these techniques to our own benefit ? 

Absolutely. 

As we will see, it goes beyond just breathing without moving. It will need balance, consciousness and a developer’s mindset.
