# The Yogi

##### Imagine a traditional picture of a Yogi : A beaming figure in lotus position. 

A life spent mastering himself. Everything else is not important. 

He can go days without much food or water. He can sit and meditate for hours. He may go to extremes to test his body and mind. 

How about the beaming part ? After all, Yogis have been depicted with radiant beams of light. 

Lets scrape their simple (not necessary easy) technique to keep energy at high levels:

**In lotus position a Yogi does not move.** 

He is balanced and relaxed. 

By not moving and by being at rest, a Yogi solves the first piece of our energy puzzle: muscles are big consumers of energy and oxygen in the body. 

Our muscles play a big role in all the energy we consume while awake. Muscles use oxygen coming from our breathing to create energy. 

We instinctively know this relationship between muscle activity and breathing. If we try to sprint or run, we have to "catch our breath".  

In fact, our muscles devour oxygen when active: to move, stand, run, swim, etc. From the moment we wake up to the moment we fall asleep, muscles are active and helping with gravity. 

**In lotus position a Yogi meditates.** 

Allow me to simplify the word meditation as the relaxing of your mind. We will go deeper into how that happens, but for now, please bare with me. 

A relaxed mind solves the second piece of our energy puzzle: the brain is another big consumer of energy and oxygen in the body. 

Lets go back to our Yogi and summarize what is going on:

His posture is balanced. His muscles are relaxed. His brain is going layer by layer to a deep state of meditation.  His energy is not being wasted by bad posture, excessive muscular activity, worries or frenetic thinking. The Yogi is oxygenating organs, cells and tissues while awake.

He may decide to breathe a notch up and increase even further the recharge of his body, like a fast charging battery. 

After awhile, he turns into those radiant beams of light. Energy is overflowing his body. 

Yogis raise their own energy to an optimal state and by a sustainable practice, keep that energy ready for use. 

Do we need to go in a cave for 20 years to learn that ? If our goal in life is to be Yogi, probably yes. Though, this is not our case. 

Can we take advantage of some of their teachings by applying these techniques to our own coding practice ?

Absolutely. 

As we will see, it goes beyond just breathing without moving. It will need balance, consciousness and a developer’s mindset. 

But first, let's understand the logic and framework of our body energy consuption.
