# The Yogi Machine

##### Imagine a traditional picture of a Yogi : A beaming figure in lotus position. 

A life spent mastering himself. Everything else is not important. 

He can go days without much food or water. He can sit and meditate for hours. He may go to extremes to test his body, mind and soul. 

How about the beaming part ? After all, Yogis have been depicted with radiant beams of light. 

Lets have a closer look at our Yogi image:

**In lotus position a Yogi does not move.** 

He is balanced and relaxed. 

By not moving and by being at rest, a Yogi solves the first piece of our puzzle: muscles are the biggest consumers of energy in the body. 

Our muscles play a big role in all the energy we consume while awake. 

They use Oxygen to create energy. As result, breathing is a key part of muscle activity. We all experience this when we try to sprint, we will naturally increase our breathing frequency. 

In fact, muscles devour Oxygen when active: to move, stand, run, swimn, etc.

Actually, since we became bipedal, a myriad of muscles is used to just keep up with gravity! 

Keeping in mind this important correlation of muscles, breath and Energy consumption. 

**In lotus position a Yogi meditates.** 

Allow me to simplify the word meditation as the relaxing of your mind. We will get deeper into how that happens, but for now, please bare with me. 

A relaxed mind solves the second piece of our puzzle : the brain is the second biggest consumer of energy in the body. 

Now let’s go back to our image: the Yogi is at rest, meditating and still breathing. Since the brain and the muscles are not consuming much, where is all that unused Oxygen going ?

Before answering this question, is there any other time where:
we stay relaxed, we do not move much and our brain goes beyond thought to a dreamy meditative state? 

Sleep. 

What happens when we sleep? We rest. How do we rest ? By not moving much and by taking our mind to a dreamy state. Sleeping is a big restful moment for our body, no doubt. 

After breathing for 8 hours in a relaxed state, we feel recharged. 

Now lets answer the question, where is all the oxygen going if the 2 biggest consumers of Energy (muscles and mind) are relaxed ? 

Everywhere else. Organs, tissues, cells…

Imagine the Yogi. His posture is balanced. His muscles are relaxed to the minimal effort. His brain is going layer by layer to a deep state of meditation or relaxation. Since he is not asleep, he may decide to breathe a notch up and get a bit more Oxygen. 

After awhile, he turns into those radiant beams of light. 

Yogis raise their own energy to an optimal state and by a sustainable practice, keep it there. The Yogi is nourishing his organs, cells, tissues while awake. 

Do we need to go in a cave for 20 years to learn that ? 

If you really want to be a Yogi, probably yes. Though, this is not our case. Can we take advantage of some of their techniques by applying them to our own benefit ? 

Absolutely. 

As we will see, it goes beyond just breathing without moving. It will require balance, consciousness and a developer’s mindset.

Now let’s go back to the our initial picture.  Our Yogi is obviously breathing. He is also at rest and balanced. If his muscles are not eating up the Oxygen, to where else is going all the Oxygen ?

The brain, as we will discuss later, has many ways to consume energy. A meditative mind has a low foot print on consuming Oxygen.
