# The Yogi Machine

##### Imagine a traditional picture of a Yogi : A beaming figure in lotus position. 

A life mastering himself. Everything else, not important. 

He can go days without much food or water. He can sit and meditate for hours. He may go to extremes to test his body, mind and soul. 

How about the beaming part ? After all, people have repeatedly drawing Yogis with an aura of energy. 

Lets have a closer look at our Yogi image:

In lotus position a Yogi does not move. He is in balance and relaxed. 

By not moving and at rest, a Yogi solves the first piece of our image puzzle: muscles are the biggest consumers of energy in the body. 

Our muscles play a big role in all the energy we consume while awake. 

How do muscles consume energy ? 
Here a paid ad from our sponsor : “Energy is brought to you by Oxygen” 

We need Oxygen to make energy. A lot of Oxygen we are breathing is going to our muscles. In fact, muscles devour oxygen when active. They help us move, stand, type, run and etc. Since we became bipedal, a miryad of muscles are used to just keep up with gravity. 

Now let’s go back to the picture, our Yogi is still breathing. He is also at rest and balanced so very little Oxygen is needed for his muscles. 

Then, to where is going all the Oxygen ?

In lotus position a Yogi meditates. Allow me to simplify the word meditation as the relaxing of your mind activity. We will get deeper on how that happens, but for now, please bare with me. 

A relaxed mind solves the second piece of our image puzzle : the brain is the second biggest consumer of energy in the body. 

The brain, as we will discuss later, has many ways to consume energy. A meditative mind has a low foot print. 

Let’s go back to the image, the Yogi is at rest, meditating and still breathing. Since the brain and the muscles are not consuming much, where is going all that extra Oxygen ?

Before answering this question, is there any other time where we stay relaxed ? we do not move ? our brain goes beyond thought to a dreamy meditative state? 
Sleep. 

What is happening when we are at sleep? We rest. How do we rest ? By not moving much and by taking our mind to a dreamy state. Sleeping is a big restful moment for our body, no doubt. 

As a result, we are recharged after 8 hours of good sleep. A bad night of sleep is usually a night we've moved a lot and stayed shallow in our mind. 

Ok, now lets answer the question, to where is going all the oxygen if muscles and mind relaxed ? Everywhere else : organs, tissues, cells…

Back again to the image of the Yogi. His posture is balanced. His muscles are relaxed to the minimal effort. His brain is going layer by layer to a deep state of meditation or relaxation. Since he is not asleep, he may decide to breathe a notch up and get a bit more oxygen. Consciously he accelerates even further his own recharging.  

He turns to beaming light and energy. 

Yogis rise their own energy to an optimal state and by a sustainable practice, keep it there. The Yogi is nourishing his organs, cells, tissues while awake. 

Do we need to go in a cave for 20 years to learn that ? 

If you really want to be a Yogi, probably yes. A better question is, can we take advantage of some of the techniques and apply to our own daily energy consumption ? 

Absolutely. 

As you will see, it goes beyond just breathing without moving. It will require balance, consciousness and a developer’s mind.
