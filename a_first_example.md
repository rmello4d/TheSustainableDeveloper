# First Challenge

Let’s get something simple such as my personal guidelines for writing this particular book. I decided to commit myself to the following rules while in front of my computer :

1. 
Before and while typing, I had to maintain an aligned and balanced body posture;
1. 
Before touching the keyboard, I had to focus on my breath first, then start typing;
1. 
If I doubt my writings or if I get indecisive about what to say, first I should notice it, then stop myself, then apply rule number 2;

Looks easy right ? Not at all. 

Lets check one by one:

… to find a body posture that is well balanced and consumes the least amount of energy is hard work. My main goal here was to stay between 4 to 6 hours in front of the computer per day and finish any session with more energy then when I started. Is it possible ? How personal energy is consumed? Is there one specific posture ? Would the same tactics apply to 2hs or 12hs of coding ? 

... to focus on my breath before touching the keyboard seemed easy but respecting this rule at all times required a Confucius determination. My main goal here was to connect with my body before “Total Thought Immersion”. Why is this relevant ? How Total Thought Immersion works ? Can I call breath.init() before any action ??

… to notice that “I am having doubts about my writings”, then stop and refocus on the breath was probably the trickiest of the rules. My main goal here was to remind me about the root of everything: consciousness.  Why is so important to understand consciousness from your own experience ?  Do I need to instantiate consciousness or is it a global variable ?

These questions and others are the inspiration for this book. As many Developers, myself included, we abuse our bodies daily. 

It is time for us to talk and discuss about self sustainability.

Let it be.
