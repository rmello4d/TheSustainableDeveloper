#One Sound After The Other

#####Someday, someone linked a sound to a meaning. 

Then, by repetition, others reproduced the same sound and meaning.

When invented, language was a magical tool and our mind was thirsty for it. 

We went crazy naming everything we could. Objects, actions, places, emotions, people. 

This first step, to create meaningful sounds, is not unique to us, other animals are also capable of the same. 

But, for us humans, a magical second step happened: we were able to 'say' the same sound in our brain without using our vocal chords.

What a great magical trick ! We concatenated meaningful sounds in our head created  a continuous flow of images and ideas.

Letâ€™s call it thinking, in the context of this book. 

how does thinking operates in our head ?  

One sound after the other.  

We think by putting sounds from our known language one after the other in our head. 

This concept of thinking is different than imagination and dreams. With imagination we are putting images one after the other, creating a cinema effect inside our head. With thinking, we are concatenating one sound after the other with our known language.

If we have no clue about the sounds and meaning of the Mandarin language for example, its quiet impossible to think in Mandarin, right? 

Also, we learn a language over time, at slow and progressive pace, sound by sound, meaning by meaning.  

Babies learn their first words around 12 months old. With 18 months, they know between 50 and 100 words. At 24 months they accumulate a vocabulary of 200 to 300 words. They jump to a 1000 one year later. 

Between 5 and 7 they've accumulated a vocabulary between 3000 to 5000 words. 

An adult may reach 40,000 words and we estimate that English speaking University students tend to be around 40-60,000 words. 

As a species, this is phenomenal. 

Thinking becomes the predominant mode of our mental activity as adults. We invest a lot of time accumulating all this knowledge. To a point that our minds are always thinking. 

We do it so much that creates a dark side. Have we ever stop to ask how much are we thinking, or how 'expensive' is?

Thinking is brutally expensive. So costly that it does not accept simultaneous action: we cannot think 2 stories *at the exactly same time* in our head.

Sure, we can tell and hold 2 or more stories in our head but we will be switching from one to the other. Try these 2 phrases:

I am super-man.
Your nose is huge.

Can we say both phrases in our mind at exactly same time ?

No.

Just compare our brain ability to process many things in parallel. Right now we are reading, listening and probably regulating our hormonal levels at the same time. 

For thinking, the brain limits itself, no parallelism is possible. Every sound must be sequenced, one after the other. It requires a great deal of focus, memory, logic and energy. 

As an adult, if you think all the time, you will be exhausted. Like a mental marathon runner. 

One sound after the other.
