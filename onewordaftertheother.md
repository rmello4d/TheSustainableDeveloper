#One Word After The Other

When invented, language was a magical tool and our brain was thirsty for it. As a result, we went crazy naming everything we could: objects, actions, places, emotions. 

Everything meaningful around us got baptised.

Humans may express structured languages in 3 ways: through our vocal chords, our brain or by writing. 

In the vocal chords we have the  birthplace of the manifested  word. Someday someone said for the first time a sound and, purposely linked that sound to a particular meaning.  

By repetition, others reproduced the same sound and meaning.

This appears to be elementary and other animals are also capable of the same, to create meaningful sounds.

But, for us humans, a magical second step happened: we were able to say the same sound in our brain without using our vocal chords.

What a great magical trick !

The concatenation of meaningful sounds in your head created something unique: a continuous flow of images and ideas.

Let’s call it thinking.  

And how does thinking operates in our head ?  

One sound after the other.  

We think by putting sounds from our known language one after the other in our head. 

Notice that this is different than imagination. With imagination we are putting images one after the other, creating a cinema effect inside our head. 

To think is to tell a story inside our brain in our known language.

If we have no clue about the sounds of mandarin language for example, to think in mandarin is quite impossible, isn’t?

Also, thinking does not accept simultaneous action: we cannot think 2 stories at the exactly same time in our head.

Sure, we can tell and hold 2 or more stories in our head but we will be switching from one to the other really quick. Here an example, try these 2 phrases:

I am super-man
Your head is big

Can you say  both phrases in your head at exactly same time ?

No.

One of our great inventions, structured language,  has also some limits despite the fact our brain can process things in parallel (right now for example you are reading, listening and probably regulating your hormonal levels at the same time).

If the brain can process things in parallel, why it is not  capable of thinking 5 different things at the same exact time ? 

For now, keep in mind that language has the property of being dominant, dictatorial and extremely powerful inside your head. No parallelism is possible.

We think by putting one sound after the other.
