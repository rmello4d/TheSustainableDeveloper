#One Word After The Other

When invented, language was a magical tool and our brain was thirsty for it. As a result, we went crazy naming everything we could: objects, actions, places, emotions. 

Everything meaningful around us got baptised.

Let's dive on how humans may express structured languages. To simplify there are 3 ways: through our vocal chords, our brain or by writing. 

In the vocal chords we have the  birthplace of the word. Someday someone said for the first time a sound and, purposely linked that sound to a particular meaning.  

By repetition, others reproduced the same sound and meaning.

To create meaningful sounds appears to be common, other animals are also capable of the same. 

But, for us humans, a magical second step happened: we were able to say the same sound in our brain without using our vocal chords.

What a great magical trick !

The concatenation of meaningful sounds in our head created something unique: a continuous flow of images and ideas.

Letâ€™s call it thinking.  

And how does thinking operates in our head ?  

One sound after the other.  

We think by putting sounds from our known language one after the other in our head. 

Notice that this is different than imagination. With imagination we are putting images one after the other, creating a cinema effect inside our head. 

To 'think' is to tell a story inside our brain in our known language.

If we have no clue about the sounds of Mandarin for example, its quiet impossible to think in Mandarin, right?

Also, thinking does not accept simultaneous action: we cannot think 2 stories at the exactly same time in our head.

Sure, we can tell and hold 2 or more stories in our head but we will be switching from one to the other really quick. Here an example, try these 2 phrases:

I am super-man
Your head is big

Can you say  both phrases in your head at exactly same time ?

No.

Our brain is quiet limited when thinking. Just compare the brain ability to process many things in parallel (right now for example we are reading, listening and probably regulating our hormonal levels at the same time). 

For thinking, no parallelism is possible. Every sound must be sequenced, one after the other.
