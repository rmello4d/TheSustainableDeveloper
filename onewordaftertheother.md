#One Sound After The Other

#####Someday, someone linked a sound to a meaning. 

Then, by repetition, others reproduced the same sound and meaning.

When invented, language was a magical tool and our mind was thirsty for it. 

We went crazy naming everything we could. Objects, actions, places, emotions, people. 

This first step, to create meaningful sounds, is not unique to us, other animals are also capable of the same. 

But, for us humans, a magical second step happened: we were able to 'say' the same sound in our brain without using our vocal chords.

What a great magical trick ! 

This concatenation of meaningful sounds in our head created  a continuous flow of images and ideas.

Letâ€™s call it thinking.  

And how does thinking operates in our head ?  

One sound after the other.  

We think by putting sounds from our known language one after the other in our head. 

Notice that this is different than imagination and dreams. With imagination we are putting images one after the other, creating a cinema effect inside our head. 

To 'think' is to tell a story inside our brain in our known language.

If we have no clue about the sounds of the Mandarin language for example, its quiet impossible to think in Mandarin, right? 

Also, thinking does not accept simultaneous action: we cannot think 2 stories at the exactly same time in our head.

Sure, we can tell and hold 2 or more stories in our head but we will be switching from one to the other. Here an example, try these 2 phrases:

I am super-man.
Your nose is huge.

Can we say both phrases in our mind at exactly same time ?

No.

Just compare the brain ability to process many things in parallel. Right now we are reading, listening and probably regulating our hormonal levels at the same time. 

For thinking, the brain is quiet limited, no parallelism is possible. Every sound must be sequenced, one after the other. 
Also, thinking requires a great deal of focus, memory accumulation and knowledge. It is one of the most incredible evolutionary advantages we have. 

But thinking has a dark side. It is addictive as sugar.
