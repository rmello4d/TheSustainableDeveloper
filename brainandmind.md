#The Working Area. Our Mind.

The distinction between brain and mind is a first step helping us understand how energy consumption affects the brain. 

As mentioned before, our brain cannot be controlled and that, is a good thing.

How about our mind ? Is controlling our mind different than controlling our brain ?

To begin with, lets agree that brain and mind are understood in different ways by different cultural and religious traditions. 

Philosophy, psychology, religion and science will give you different answers. By consequence, trying to define them with precision is counter productive.  

It will be out of our scope to impose a definition that can settle the different views. Said that, it is possible to give some context to help us. Our goal is to create an organic understanding about the mind and brain relation.

In the context of this book, the mind is the areas of the brain susceptible to some control.

To be more precise, concepts such as awareness, memory, thoughts, reasoning and judgments fall in that category.  We have some control over these brain functions. Note that we did not added consciousness to the list, we will see why in a later chapter. 

But let's take our memory for example. Memory is an area of our brain that we can apply some control. Can we remember some of the things happened with us yesterday? Hopefully yes.

To give an opposite example, could we tell the last time we ordered a signal to our adrenal glands to produce more cortisone? No, such a thing is not our decision or susceptible to control, therefore not in our mind.

This simple and organic idea of the mind opens a wonderful environment to work with.

Lets explore 3 essential elements of our minds that impact energy consuption. 

Get ready for the 'language', the energy eater.
