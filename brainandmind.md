#The Mind.

As mentioned before, controlling the brain is not possible and that, is a good thing.

How about our mind ? Is controlling our mind different than controlling our brain ?

To begin with, the brain and mind have different meanings by different cultural and religious traditions. 

Philosophy, psychology, religion and science will give you different answers when trying to box these concepts. By consequence, trying to define them with precision is counter productive.  

It will be out of our scope to impose a definition that can settle the different views. Said that, it is possible to give some context to help us. Our goal is to create an organic understanding about the mind and brain relation.

In the context of this book, lets define the mind as the areas of the brain susceptible to some control.

To be more precise, concepts such as focus, memory, thoughts, reasoning and judgments fall in that category.  We have some control over these brain functions. Note that we did not added consciousness to the list, we will see why later. 

But let's take our memory for example. Memory is an area of our brain that we can apply some control. Can we remember some of the things happened with us yesterday? Hopefully yes.

To give an opposite example, could we tell the last time we ordered a signal to our adrenal glands to produce more cortisone? No, such a thing is not our decision or susceptible to control, therefore not in our definition of the mind.

This distinction between brain and mind is a first step to understand how energy consumption affects the brain. 

It will be important to explore the 3 essential elements of our minds that impact energy consumption. 

First is 'language', the energy eater. 

Let's understand how language works.
