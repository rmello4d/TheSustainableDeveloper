The game between brain and mind.

The distinction between brain and mind is important. As previously discussed,  your brain cannot be controlled and that is probably a good thing.

How about your mind ? Is controlling your mind different than controlling your brain ?

To begin with, lets realize that brain and mind are understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Philosophy, psychology, religion and science will give you different answers. By consequence, trying to define with precision is counter productive, it will be out of our scope to impose a definition that can settle the different views but, it is possible to give some context that will help to create an organic way of understanding the mind and brain relation:

In the context of this book, the mind is the brain susceptible to some control.

To be more precise, concepts such as awareness, consciousness, memory, thoughts, reasoning and judgments fall in that category. You have some control over theses brain functions.

Take your memory for example, to some extent, memory is an area of your brain that you can apply some control: Can you remember some of the things that happened with you yesterday? Hopefully yes.

Just to clarify, I am not saying that just the controllable part of your memory is your mind.  The memory you can't control or access entirely is also part of your mind. The whole memory package is important for the mind.

To give you the opposite example, could you tell me the last time you ordered a signal to your adrenal glands to produce more cortisone ? No, such a thing is not your decision or susceptible to control, therefore not in your mind.

This simple and organic idea of the mind consisting of brain areas susceptible to some control opens a wonderful environment to work in.

Lets now understand some of the key elements of your mind.
