#The Mind 

The distinction between brain and mind is important. As discussed in the last chapter, our brain cannot be controlled and that is probably a good thing.

How about your mind ? Is controlling your mind different than controlling your brain ?

To begin with, lets understand that brain and mind are understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. 

Philosophy, psychology, religion and science will give you different answers. By consequence, trying to define with precision is counter productive.  

It will be out of our scope to impose a definition that can settle the different views. Said that, it is possible to give some context to help us on creating an organic way of understand the mind and brain relation.

In the context of this book, the mind is the areas of the brain susceptible to some control.

To be more precise, concepts such as awareness, memory, thoughts, reasoning and judgments fall in that category. We have some control over these brain functions.

Take our memory for example, to some extent, memory is an area of our brain that we can apply some control: Can we remember some of the things that happened with us yesterday? Hopefully yes.

To give an opposite example, could we tell the last time we ordered a signal to our adrenal glands to produce more cortisone? No, such a thing is not our decision or susceptible to control, therefore not in our mind.

This simple and organic idea of the mind consisting of brain areas susceptible to some control opens a wonderful environment to work in.

Lets now understand some of the key elements of our minds.
