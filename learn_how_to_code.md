# For non-coders

This chapter is for you,  wife or husband, friend, father or mother, lover of a developer. 

The goal is to understand the idea of coding and how a developer's mind develop its traits.

First, they need to know a computer language. Would English or French be similar languages? Not really. 

Computer languages are minimal. Think about a language with only 50 reserved words for example. This is the real case of a popular language in the programming world. 

Now, lets say we want the computer to simulate a person 'running' (John).  The problem is, as you already guessed, 'run' does not exist in such small computer's vocabulary.

How our beloved husband and developer put John to run ? 

Lets assume that 'step' and 'speed' are words available in our computer's language. Our dear father and developer get these 2 words and tell the computer the following instructions : 

```
step,

increase speed,

repeat           
```
*ps. repeat is a 'magical' word in the computer vocabulary. Once the computer see the word repeat, it will go back to the first step and run the batch of instructions again. Notice that, running the batch again means that we will end on another reapeat, creating a perpetual loop. *

As you probably noticed with tears, by now, John is dead. We told the computer to increase the speed in every repeat. John will start at 0 and increase his speed until he is a Ferrari, then a rocket, then...kaboom!

Since we are in a perpetual loop created by the repeat instruction, the speed will keep growing higher and higher. 

To get more real, our cool friend and developer will go back and 'fix' the instructions to avoid this problem. Let's give 10 km/h as a speed limit for John ? Great! 

```
step,

if speed is less than 10 km/h, 
then increase speed  

repeat 
```

Wait a minute. What is that long instruction ? 

Computers have a great ability to compute and to be logical. Computer Languages exploit that by supplying developers with a series of special words: 

'if', 'then', 'else', 'equal', 'less than', 'repeat' and etc. 

Knowing these words is almost mandatory to code.

Our new 'if' instruction is telling the computer to test if the speed is less than 10km/h. If so, then increase the speed.   

That will allow John to start at 0 and increase his speed until 10 km/h.  No more speed increases for John after that. 

Is John getting out of this alive ? Not quiet yet. We solve one problem, now he will not be a Ferrari. He is now running at 10 km/h, which is a good running speed. 

The problem now is that John will run forever. He is like Pheidippides in the Marathon Batle. Pheidippidis run from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens to announce that the Persians had been defeated. Then, kaboom! 
Can our lover and developer fix it again and for Godsake keep John alive ? Let's say John will run for 20 mins ? 

```
step,

if speed is less than 10 km/h, 
then increase speed 

repeat until 
time is equal 20 mins. 

stop
```

Now, John is smiling at you while he passes running by! 

He started at 0 by stepping and increasing his speed progressively until 10 km/h. He is running ! 

After 20 mins running he will stop. 

The important message here is the process. The alegory shows a basic principle of software development. We need to tell a story to a computer using a short language.  

We may kill some Johns along the way to proof our story. After some tries, we hopefully get it right.  

The last and important detail. There are infinite ways to tell a story. The art of storytelling could turn a program into a poem,  a novel or a greek tragedy. Every husband and developer is different. 



> Curiosities :

Every computer language has a set of reserved words. Some have 50 others have 400 keywords. The number of words does not mean power, both languages are able to tell a story. 

Every computer language is different, like English and French for example. Having said that, a program written in one language could be really hard to understand if the developer does not know that language. 

Is there similar computer languages like Portuguese and Spanish ? Yes, languages like Perl and PHP are similar, you can jump from one to the other and quiet understand what they are saying.
