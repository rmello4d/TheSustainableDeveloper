# Don't be afraid

If you are not a developer, here a simple analogy to understand how a developer mind works while coding. T

he basic principle is language. They need to know a computer language.

Computer languages are minimal. The brain of a computer understand just a few words. 

Lets say you want to make your computer understand the concept of a person (John) 'running'. The problem is, the computer vocabulary does not have 'run' as a word. In that sense, the computer is a little childish. 

How Developers tell the computer to put John to run ? 

A Developer knows that 'step' and 'speed' are words available in the computer's brain. Great! He tells the computer : 

```
step,
step,
increase speed,
repeat 
```
*ps. repeat will go back to the first step which will end in another reapeat, creating a perpetual loop. *


By now, John is dead. Our new Developer is increasing the speed all the time. 
In a few hours it will kill the poor John. 

How the Developer solves this issue ? 

```
step,
step,
increase speed only if speed < 10km/h 
repeat 
```

If you understand this code, you are ready to start your career as software developer. 

We fix the code by telling the computer to increase the speed only if we are running at less than 10km/h. 

Because of that, the computer will increase the speed until 10km/h then, only steps. John will be running at 10km/h, no more than that. 

Does John get out of this run alive ? Not quiet yet. As you can see, the repeat will never stop, so, the person will be running forever at 10km/h. No fun. 

Lets fix again and say John will run for 20 mins.

```
step,
step,
increase speed only if speed < 10km/h 
repeat until time is equal 20 mins. 
```

John is now smiling at you while he passed by running...

This small alegory shows the basic principle of software development. You need a language, a story and a computer or in other words, we use a reduced language to tell a story to a computer.
