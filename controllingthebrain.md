# Brain Control

Can you control your brain ?

No.

It is important to dismistify the frenzy around posessing that magical power. 

The brain was not meant or designed to be "controlled".

Our brain is like an ocean receiving all the flowing rivers from the senses and that is not part of your decisions. 

You can see your brain as a "super recorder" running in a forever 'on' mode.

Your brain registers everything you touch, listen, see, taste, smell, eat. Even when you sleep your brain is active. 

Think of a black hole grabbing and absorbing everything within range of your sensory boundaries. 

Nothing escapes.

On top of that, the brain is wired to regulate lots of activities in your body, from hormones delivery to blood circulation.

Bottom line: the brain is a vital organ and nature was smart enough to take the control off your hands. 

Do you control your heart ? Your liver ? No, and that is a good thing. Vital organs are self regulated, independent of your control and the brain falls in that category.

Your brain is not your puppet.   It is an organ too complex, powerful and designed to go beyond your control.

Having said that, if we can't control it, what's all the fuss about it ?
