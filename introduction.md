# Introduction

#### This book is dedicated to personal sustainability.  

I joyfully dedicated many years of my professional life to music and software development. Although physically active, after 15 years I had problems related to body exhaustion.  Unfortunately, these problems were partially neglected and they soon became permanent injury.  

By that time, someone recommend Meditation and Yoga. My first class was in 1999 and rapidly, Yoga and Meditation became important to me. I dove in deeper and deeper. To my surprise, I was not just getting better at Yoga and Meditation,  I was getting better as a Developer and a Musician. Since 1999, both careers also took off.  

This book tells my experiences based on a path of failures and successes as a Software developer, Musician and Yoga teacher.   

They are personal but hopefully will help you as well. 

Just to be clear, this book does not offer any magical solution to become a super developer. Rather, this book points a direction. It tackles a neglected side of software development: personal sustainability. 

As you will see in the book, the Sustainable Developer is not a guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe. 

Sorry. 
 
The Sustainable Developer mainly understands how personal energy is consumed and how he can benefit from it. That alone, can transform your personal life.    

From a positive side, these last 25 years showed me that developers have yogi and artist capabilities to a surprising levels. Let me suggest further that these capabilities can be refined to a new high level if explored under different lens. 

A real example ? 

Let’s get something simple such as my personal guidelines for writing this particular book. I decided to commit myself to the following rules while in front of my computer :

While typing, my body posture had to be aligned and balanced; 
Before touching the keyboard, I had to focus on my breath first, then start typing;
If I doubt my writings or if I get indecisive about what to say, first I should notice it, then stop myself, then apply rule number 2;

Looks easy right ? Not at all. 

Lets check one by one:

… to find a body posture that is well balanced and consumes the least amount of energy is hard work. My main goal here was to stay between 4 to 6 hours in front of the computer per day and eventually finish any session with more energy then when I started. Is it possible ? How my personal energy is consumed ? Is there one specific posture ? Would the same tactics apply to 2hs or 12hs of coding ? 

... to focus on my breath before touching the keyboard seemed easy but respecting this rule at all times required a Confucius determination. My main goal here was to connect with my body before “Total Thought Immersion”. Why is this relevant ? How Total Thought Immersion works ? Can I call breath.init() before any action ??

… to notice that “I am having doubts about my writings”, then noticed, then stop and refocus on the breath was probably the trickiest of the rules. My main goal here was to remind me about the root of everything: consciousness.  Why is so important to understand consciousness from your own experience ?  Do I need to instantiate consciousness or is it a global variable ?

These questions and others are the inspiration for this book. As many developers, myself included, we abuse our bodies daily. 

It is about time to a discussion about personal sustainability. 

Oh, will there be any coding examples ? Yes.  Although having coding examples, I will try my best to invite non-coders to understand our world, so do not expect coding techniques in this book.

Last but not least, let me kindly suggest,  please share your opinion about anything you believe wrong in this book.  As for the parts you agree, be my guest to spread and enlarge this conversation even further. 

Enjoy it !
