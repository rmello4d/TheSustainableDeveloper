# Introduction

##### This book is about personal sustainability.  

I joyfully dedicated my professional life to music and software development. After 15 years I had problems related to body exhaustion. These problems were partially neglected and they soon became permanent injury.  

By that time, someone recommend Meditation and Yoga. My first class was in 1999 and Yoga and Meditation became important to me. I dove in deeper and deeper. To my surprise, I was not just getting better at Yoga and Meditation,  I was getting better as a Developer and a Musician. Since 1999, both careers also took off.  

This book tells my failures and successes as a Software developer, Musician and Yoga teacher.   

They are personal but hopefully will help you as well. 

Just to be clear, this book does not offer any magical solution to become a super developer. Rather, this book points a direction. It tackles a neglected side of software development: personal sustainability. 

As you will see, the Sustainable Developer is not a guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe. 

Sorry. 
 
The Sustainable Developer understands how we consume personal energy. He can enjoy this knowledge to get more energy and focus on daily tasks. That alone, may transform your personal life.    


Oh, will there be any coding examples ? Yes.  Although I will try my best to invite non-coders to understand our world. Do not expect coding techniques in this book.

Last but not least, let me kindly suggest,  please share your opinion about anything you believe wrong in this book.  As for the parts you agree, be my guest to spread and enlarge this conversation even further. 

Enjoy it !

Guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe.
