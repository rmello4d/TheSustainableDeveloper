# The Sustainable Developer

The act of coding demands a considerable mental and physical effort.  As a result, we (developers) often abuse ourselves while in front of the computer. 

This book tackles a neglected side of software development: 

Self-Sustainability. 

Is it possible to establish a sustainable coding practice ? Is it possible to engage in 6hs coding sessions and leave them with more energy than at the beginning ? Absolutely.  

Probably no other culture has dedicated more time in understanding the body and mind as have the Yogis. As we will see in the book, there is an untapped value in the crossings of these two worlds: developers and yogis. They have lots in common. 

Is this book about Yoga poses ? No. Is this book showing how I can twirl my body in all directions ? No. 

This book is about putting the developer as the starting point, then  exploring the techniques in Meditation and Yoga from his perspective. 

These last 25 years showed me that developers have Yogic capabilities to surprising levels. To suggest further, we can refine these capabilities to a higher level, if looked under different lens.

Just to be clear, the Sustainable Developer is not a guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe. 

Sorry. 
 
Rather, The Sustainable Developer understands how to use his personal energy more efficiently. His body and mind get clear. Then, he can enjoy this knowledge by increasing his focus on daily tasks and at work. 

The Sustainable Developer is making the act of coding special to his body and mind. 

That alone, may transform your personal and professional life.    

Also, this book is primarily meant for coders but I also invite non-coders to understand our world. Will there be any coding examples ? Yes, but do not expect coding techniques or frameworks.  

Last but not least, please share your opinion about anything you believe right or wrong in this book. One way or the other, you are helping to spread and enlarge this conversation even further. 

Guru-ninja-master.
