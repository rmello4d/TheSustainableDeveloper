# The Sustainable Developer

The act of coding demands a considerable mental and physical effort.  

As a result, most developers strain themselves while in front of the computer. Along the years, pain and inflammation may be a common feeling in their lives.  

Is it possible to establish a sustainable coding practice ? 

Is it possible to be engaged in 6hs coding sessions and leave them with more energy than at the beginning ? 

Absolutely.  

This book tackles a neglected reality in the developer's community: self-sustainability. 

Probably no other culture has dedicated more time in understanding the body and mind as have the Yogis. 

As we will discover, there is an untapped value in the crossings of these two worlds: developers and yogis. They have lots in common. 

Is this book about Yoga poses ? No. 

Is this book showing how we can twirl our body in all directions ? No. 

This book puts the developer as the starting point. From there, we  explore the techniques in Meditation and Yoga that are suitable for the developer. 

These last 25 years showed me that developers have yogic capabilities to surprising levels. Just to be clear, the Sustainable Developer is not a guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe. 

Sorry. 
 
Rather, The Sustainable Developer understands how to use personal energy more efficiently. The body and mind get clear.  

The Sustainable Developer is making the act of coding special to his body and mind as well. That alone, may transform your personal and professional life.    

Also, this book is primarily meant for coders but I also invite non-coders to enjoy it. Will there be any coding examples ? Yes, but do not expect coding techniques or frameworks.  

Guru-ninja-master.
