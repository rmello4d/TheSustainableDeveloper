# The Sustainable Developer

This book explores techniques in Meditation and Yoga in order to tackle a neglected side of software development: 

Self-Sustainability. 

The act of coding demands a considerable effort both physically and mentally.  No other culture has dedicated more time to understand the body and mind as the Hindus. 

These last 25 years showed me that developers have Yogic capabilities to a surprising levels. To suggest further, these capabilities can be refined to a higher level if looked under different lens. 

Just to sure, the Sustainable Developer is not a guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe. 

Sorry. 
 
Rather, The Sustainable Developer understands how to use and manipulate its own personal energy. He can enjoy this knowledge by increasing his focus on daily tasks and at work. He can transform the act of coding in something truly special.  

That alone, may transform your personal and professional life.    

Guru-ninja-master.
