# The Sustainable Developer

This book tackles a neglected side of software development: self sustainability. 

These last 25 years showed me that developers have yogi and artist capabilities to a surprising levels. Let me suggest further that we can refine these capabilities to a new higher level if explored under different lens. 

As you will see, the Sustainable Developer is not a guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe. 

Sorry. 
 
The Sustainable Developer understands how to use and manipulate personal energy. He can enjoy this knowledge by increasing his focus on daily tasks and at work. That alone, may transform your personal life.    

Guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe.
