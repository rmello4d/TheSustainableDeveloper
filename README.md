# The Sustainable Developer

The act of coding demands a considerable mental and physical effort.  

As a result, most developers strain themselves while in front of the computer. 

Along the years, body pain and inflammation may be a common feeling in their lives.  

Is it possible to establish a sustainable coding practice ? Is it possible to engage 6hs coding sessions and leave them with more energy than you had at the beginning ? 

Absolutely.  

This book tackles self-sustainability. 

The Sustainable Developer is enhancing his body and mind during the act of coding - that alone - may transform your personal and professional life.
