# The Sustainable Developer

This book explores techniques in Meditation and Yoga in order to tackle a neglected side of software development: 

Self-Sustainability. 

The act of coding demands a considerable effort,  both physical and mental. No other culture has dedicated more time in understanding the body and mind as have the Hindus. There is an untapped value to be discovered in the crossing of these worlds. Developers and Yogis have lots in common. 

These last 25 years showed me that developers have Yogic capabilities to a surprising levels. To suggest further, these capabilities can be refined to a higher level if looked under different lens. 

Just to be sure, the Sustainable Developer is not a guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe. 

Sorry. 
 
Rather, The Sustainable Developer understands how to use and manipulate its own personal energy. His body and mind get clear.  He can enjoy this knowledge by increasing his focus on daily tasks and at work. He makes the act of coding something truly special.  

That alone, may transform your personal and professional life.    

Guru-ninja-master.
