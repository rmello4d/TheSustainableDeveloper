# The Sustainable Developer

These last 25 years showed me that developers have yogi capabilities to a surprising levels. To suggest further, these capabilities can be refined to a new higher level if explored under different lens. 

This book explores techniques in Meditation and Yoga in order to tackle a neglected side of software development: self-sustainability. 

As you will see, the Sustainable Developer is not a guru-ninja-master of all things in the universe. 

Sorry. 
 
Rather, The Sustainable Developer understands how to use and manipulate its own personal energy. He can enjoy this knowledge by increasing his focus on daily tasks and at work. 

That alone, may transform your personal life.    

Guru-ninja-master.
